## [Unreleased] — protocol v5e: every frozen gate passed, the red team still said no

*Not shipped. Nothing in `styxx/` changes behaviour for released versions; v5e lives on the development branch until a
repair survives its own red team.*

- **Protocol v5e ("mint-and-anchor").** A gate declares `"exercises"` and optionally a `"section"`. `score()` refuses unless
  each declared function ran on the stack of an opening of that section. Each declared function gets a freshly minted code
  object, and a section is a call credited only while its opening frame is on the live stack above the asyncio dispatch cut.
  The redesign came after three rounds had broken v5b, v5c and v5d.
- **Examined before the red team saw it:**
  - 15/15 frozen exam gates, including 57/57 in the mutation gate;
  - 10/10 aux gates: an oracle fuzzer (3000 programs, 0 disagreements), an independent second implementation (0 trace
    differences) and four CPython versions.
- **Red-team round 4: NOT SHIPPABLE.** 58 of 60 findings were confirmed by independent reproducers and scope judges.
  - 6 are blockers, and 29 are exam holes.
  - Every rebuilt round-1..3 blocker held.
  - All six blockers reproduce on the second implementation too: they are in the spec.
  - A seventh blocker-class failure surfaced after the round. On CPython 3.13 an ordinary signal during tracer exit can
    leave the lock held; the cause is CPython issue #130279.
- **New instruments** (exploratory):
  - `papers/first-afference/fault_injection_v5.py`: an exception at every opcode the machinery executes, along five
    scenarios.
  - `protocol_v5_redteam/round4/capture_recapture.py`: Chao2 over red-team lenses.
  - `protocol_v5_redteam/round4_exam_mutation/semantic_mutation_census.py`: the frozen exam caught 27 of 63 weakened-rule mutants.
  - `protocol_v5_redteam/round4/blockers_against_nversion.py`.
  - `mutation_gate_blindspots.py`: 8 of 9 alternative emission shapes escape the frozen mutation gate.
- **Self-corrections, certified:**
  - `ERRATUM_v5_hand_scored_claim_2026_09_24.md`;
  - `disjoint-worlds/CORRECTION_open_set_read_null_2026_09_24.md`;
  - the round-4 finding, whose draft went through three attack passes before certification.

## [Unreleased] — the gate was pointed at itself, and the measurement is what came back

*Staged for 7.48.0. Cutting the release also requires regenerating `conformance/sworn/` — the
committed set pins `provenance.styxx_version`, so bumping `styxx/_version.py` invalidates its
digest until `python conformance/sworn/gen_vectors.py` is re-run in an environment whose
regeneration matches CI's. That step is deliberately not in this change.*

The release where the diff gate stopped being graded by the people who wrote it. Eleven
preregistered cycles against 71,016 agent pull requests from the AIDev corpus (CC-BY-4.0, Zenodo
10.5281/zenodo.16919272). Four of them voided themselves. The two that produced the headline
numbers were the two that made the instrument look worse.

**The reading, repaired under preregistration**

- **BC-2** — a scope prefix is checked for path shape before it is used. "only modifies the footer"
  is not a directory. **569 accusations removed, none added**, the verified side intact. BC-1 was
  declared INVALID first, on its own blocking gate.
- **BIN-2** — the raw-diff doors see binary files, pure renames, mode changes and quoted paths.
  BIN-1 was declared INVALID first, for the same reason.
- **COMPAT-1 / COMPAT-2** — compatibility claims are read rather than judged: which public
  definitions the diff removed, split by surface versus test/example/internal scaffolding, with
  signature changes reported separately. **8,467 compat claims read, 211 candidates, not one
  accusation.** The verdict is pinned to UNCHECKABLE by a flag a test holds false; only a blind
  panel can license a second verdict.
- **HARNESS-1** — the corpus reconstruction stopped folding merge traffic into pull requests.
  **16 accusations and 247 removed-name readings were the harness's, not the agents'.**
- **EXTERNAL-5** — 70 of 96 surviving accusations were checked at source and hold; 19 were the
  harness's.
- **PATH-1** — basename prefixes match anywhere in the tree, and a dotted identifier is no longer a
  path. `Assert.NotNull` is a symbol; `appservice/package.json` is a `package.json`.

**The measurements, including the ones that went against us**

- **BENCH-1 — INVALID.** The first PR-claim benchmark failed its own blocking audit: 30 of 50
  hand-audited items disagreed. Its oracle read the word after "only" as a path and called 279
  honest pull requests liars. The instrument abstained on 276 of those 279.
- **BENCH-2 — INVALID.** The repaired oracle failed too, and this time the errors were ours as
  well. Hand adjudication of every accusation the instrument made on this corpus found **9 of 11
  were wrong** — precision **0.18** on the one claim kind where it accuses. Named in full, with the
  instrument's own reason strings, in the RESULT and in issue #128.
- **DECIDE-1.** 100 claims read by hand, no oracle, each with a written reason. **71% of these
  claims are decidable from the diff** (corpus-weighted) while the instrument returns a verdict on
  5.7% of `only_touches`. The silence we had been describing as principled restraint is mostly
  extraction failure. This overturned our own public statement of the week before, and the
  correction is in the RESULT.
- **PATH-1 moved precision from 0.18 to 0.25.** Predicted before the change, measured after, and
  still a bad number: three quarters of the instrument's accusations on this claim kind remain
  false. Four of the six known failure modes are not repaired, and tests assert the instrument is
  still wrong on them so a later change cannot claim them silently.
- **SCOPE-1 — ABANDONED, and nothing shipped.** A repair that would have taken precision on this
  claim kind from 0.25 to 1.00 by withholding whenever no changed path lies inside the claimed
  scope. Preregistered with its cost stated first, then measured: across all 299 `only_touches`
  claims it moves **exactly the six items it was derived from and nothing else**, so the number it
  produces is the hypothesis restated. The held-out set that would have decided it — the 123 pull
  requests BENCH-2 could not reach — re-probed one day later to **107 HTTP 403, 14 empty, 2 HTTP
  404, 0 newly reachable**. It would also have cut coverage from 5.4% to 3.3% of a claim space
  DECIDE-1 showed is 52% decidable. The six false accusations stay in the instrument.

**The datasets**

`papers/closed-model-frontier/bench{1,2}_dataset.jsonl` — 604 claims from 568 pull requests, with
the live diff's sha256 per row, published under AIDev's CC-BY-4.0. **styxx's own verdicts are
deliberately absent**: we do not publish accusations against third parties' pull requests, and
having found 9 of 11 wrong we would rather nobody took ours on trust. `bench_reproduce.py`
re-fetches every diff, verifies each hash, re-runs the oracle and scores styxx — or any other
checker — in one command. `BENCH_DATASHEET.md` leads with both invalidations. Re-fetched end to
end on 2026-09-18 by `scope1_footprint.py`: **566 of 568 diffs match their published sha256, 2
mismatch because the pull request gained commits since, 0 unreachable**, and PATH-1's 8
accusations at precision 0.25 come back identically from a script that shares no state with it.

**The port, and the guard that was not guarding**

`web/gate/diffgate.js` carries the COMPAT-2 reading; the differential reads **3,220 pairs, 6,933
claims, 0 disagreements**. It was found inert for a cycle: no workflow ran it, its instrument pin
had gone stale and it was exiting to nobody, and a new pinned corpus was one `.gitignore` line from
never existing. `tests/test_port_is_current.py` fails on every one of those, and was validated by
failing ten times against the unfixed tree.

**Also**

- `--pr <url>` gates a public pull request by URL with no checkout.
- `integrations/git/commit-msg` refuses a commit whose message contradicts the staged diff.

---

## [Unreleased] — a commit-msg hook: the message cannot lie about the staged diff

`integrations/git/commit-msg`, one file, copied into `.git/hooks/`: every commit message is read
against `git diff --cached` by `styxx.diffgate.gate_diff_text`, each diff-shaped claim printed as
`[ok ]` / `[LIE]` / `[ ? ]`, and the commit refused on a CONTRADICTED claim (`--no-verify`
overrides, and git never installs hooks from a checkout, so it is opt-in per clone). "tests pass"
stays UNCHECKABLE in the hook by design: running the suite there would hand the agent's shell a
second place to write the verdict it wants. Git's own `#` commentary is stripped before reading,
an empty message and an unmeasurable diff both pass on scope, and a missing `styxx` skips with a
notice rather than blocking the commit. It pairs with the "write the commit message before the
code" habit — the message becomes a preregistration and this is the half that checks whether it
came true. Verdict logic untouched; `tests/test_git_commit_msg_hook.py` runs the hook the way
git runs it, in a real temporary repository, including once installed as a real hook.

## [Unreleased] — the sand check turned on itself: the series red-teamed on the lab's second machine before it was pushed

**Ten adversarial reviewers, one skeptic per dimension, on 2026-09-13; no blocker or defect finding
was refuted. Every repair is a new commit; no sworn document and no frozen PREREG was edited. The
findings and their repairs, briefly — `papers/checksum/DUE_DILIGENCE_2026_09_13.md` §7 has the
longer list.**

**2026-09-15 — the sand survey's fetchers presented as browsers; an erratum stands beside passes 3 and 4.**
`fetch_pass3.py`, `fetch_pass4.py`, the pass-4 correction's scripts and the red team's probes sent a user agent
beginning `Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)`. The lab's rule is that no request presents as a browser.
- **The method was frozen before any request.** A non-browser re-fetch of the 71 recorded URLs was committed and pushed
  at 8273cdda before it sent anything (`papers/plates/sand_survey_user_agent_inputs/`).
- **Outcomes.** 45 same bytes; 10 same kind; 14 refused then and now; 1 rate-limited; **1 answered then and refuses
  now: L16**, ACM's artifact-badging page (403).
- **L16 decides nothing.** It is one of five pass-3 occupiers of the bounty clause. Pass 4 and its correction price that
  clause UNPRICED on B23.
- **The erratum.** `ERRATUM_sand_survey_user_agent_2026_09_15.md` was attacked by two skeptics and a fact-checker
  before swearing, and nine defects in its first draft were repaired. It is sworn 31 of 31 at 4b8c055c and is ferry
  entry 257, head `8a0ee53b…`.
- **The false statements it corrects.** The pass-4 SURVEY's "one probe sent a browser user agent", commit c398e830's "No
  route presents as a browser", and the red team's "No browser user agent was sent".
- **Pass 5.** Its protocol fetches as `fathom-lab-sand-survey/5` and reads no archived text that a non-browser request
  cannot get.

**2026-09-15 — pass 4 red-teamed and corrected.** Seven finders attacked pass 4, with skeptics on every finding: of
44 findings, 33 were confirmed, 9 refuted and 2 split (`papers/plates/sand_survey_pass4_inputs/redteam/`).
`PROTOCOL_sand_pass4_correction_2026_09_15.md` was frozen at 9dbf4092 before any correction fetch or reading.
`CORRECTION_sand_neighbours_pass4_2026_09_15.md` stands beside the unedited sworn SURVEY.
- **The sentence names new neighbours.** Xu et al. leaves it: re-coded under the pass-4 definitions, it is at
  distance two, where pass 3's undefined terms had put it at distance one. Four sources are at distance one and all
  are named: DiFR and Chauvin et al. without the interval, Gao et al. and Hochlehnert et al. without
  log-probabilities. Four blind readers re-coded Hochlehnert et al., and none put it at distance one.
- **The earlier passes' fingerprint sources are coded by element.** All 23 from passes 2 and 3 were re-read from
  their hashed bytes.
- **Two READ sources were not articles.** B11, an alphaXiv summary page, is now read from its arXiv paper. B12, a
  Nature paywall stub, is SKIMMED. B05 and B07 are read from their open PDFs.
- **The statuses hold, and the conjunction is recorded.** C4a stays OCCUPIED, C5 stays UNPRICED (B23), and the
  conjunction is RETIRED.
- **Builder and review.** `build_sand_survey_pass4_correction.py` implements the correction's rules. An adversarial
  review before its first real run confirmed 14 defects in its first version, and each was repaired with a test (29
  tests).
- **Statements corrected.** Fourteen false or overstated statements in the SURVEY are corrected, with times, among
  them "each written before the result it could have bent was known".

**2026-09-14, later still — the sand priced a fourth time.** `PROTOCOL_sand_prior_art_pass4_2026_09_15.md`
(frozen at 5d7f39ef before the first query) defined the fingerprint clause's elements and a frozen three-engine
search. `SURVEY_sand_neighbours_pass4_2026_09_14.md` is sworn 50 of 50 and is ferry log line 255.
- **The fingerprint clause stays occupied, at distance one.** Gao, Liang and Guestrin's Model Equality Testing lacks
  log-probabilities. DiFR and Chauvin et al.'s Log Probability Tracking each lack an interval on the comparison.
  Xu et al. lacks the same-weights floor. In a margin check, four blind readers re-coded each of the three pass-4
  sources, and one of five readings of Chauvin et al. carries all five elements.
- **The bounty clause is unpriced** by one unfetchable source and leaves the sentence (`SURVIVES_WITHOUT_C5`).
- New: `papers/plates/build_sand_survey_pass4.py` (20 tests), `build_sand_survey_pass4_margins.py`, and
  `sand_survey_pass4_inputs/` (the fetcher, the search and screen record, the located fetch routes, the
  landing-page scope, the reader prompts and returns).
- Disclosed defects: the frozen arXiv syntax returned nothing. The first search merge, the Semantic Scholar retry
  rule, the midpoint proof and the sentence composer were each wrong once, and each was repaired before the record was committed, some after the result it touched had been seen (see the
  2026-09-15 correction above).

**2026-09-14, evening — the day's own work red-teamed: eight finder dimensions, two skeptics per blocker
or defect; 13 findings confirmed (one blocker), 5 plausible, 5 refuted; a verification of those repairs the same night confirmed 8 more (one blocker), repaired below. Repairs are new commits; no sworn
document and no frozen PREREG was edited — the two sworn documents at fault get CORRECTIONs beside them.**
- **Blocker, withdrawn by CORRECTION: the beacon-draw PREREG said the drawn values "could not have been
  computed before the slot existed".** They can: the 778-item pool is public and a fingerprint scores items
  independently. The beacon orders the selection of the 48, not the computation.
  `CORRECTION_prereg_beacon_draw_2026_09_14.md` (anchor #6b) withdraws it; SEALS and `styxx/beacon.py`'s
  docstring ("removes the advance knowledge") are corrected.
- **Anyone could have front-run a seal.** `styxx.clock`'s earliest-memo scan counted every listed memo
  carrying the digest, including transfers other keys sent the creator wallet; the digests are printed in
  SEALS before sealing. Candidates are now resolved and count only if the wallet signed them with exactly
  the seal memo; `clock verify` prints a beacon only on an ANCHORED line (7ef0e7ac). The verification found the scan could still be blocked for good, and an ANCHORED seal revoked, by two hundred memos carrying the digest or fifty thousand later transactions; it now reads only the history older than the seal, a verifier can raise its limit (`--max-candidates`), and two wallet seals in one slot are the same beacon (e7108ccb).
- **H1's held-out form does not escape its by-construction problem.** `probe_h1_held_out.py`: identical
  weights read SAME 60/60 when the loads are bit-identical and 9 to 12 of 60 otherwise, and DRIFT once at
  two scales. The CORRECTION fixes the reading before the run; `score.py` applies it.
- **`score.py` v2** re-derives what v1 trusted: K1 from the floor, the sealed digest without a flag, a
  48-item draw, every arm grading the drawn set; a valid K1-killed run is a result. Its tests parse every
  band out of the frozen text and pin every comparator on its edge; 28 of 28 mutations caught (4e08cf28); the verification then showed 15 of 18 further mutations surviving, and the published list (`papers/checksum/score_mutations.py` and its result file) now kills 92 of 92.
- **`styxx.stranger` v2**: a `.md` edited beside an untouched sidecar read PASS (`check` on a sidecar never
  opens it); now compared byte for byte. Document verdicts are tallied, a dirty tree FAILS unless
  `--allow-dirty`, a short head is refused, committed scorecards must name the certs bytes, fingerprints
  beside beacon-drawn certs are re-checked, and a directory named `*_certs*` no longer hides them.
- **The repairs, verified and repaired again** (six areas, two skeptics per finding; then three repair
  batches, each in its own worktree with two reviewers and a repair round). The scorer: a beacon-draw card
  without `--expect-beacon` is never a result; when K1 did not fire every arm cert, the held-out cert and the
  canary hash must exist; `is_the_experiment` is cross-checked against tag, smoke, git head (empty counts as
  missing) and a dirty tree; H5 waits when the hand set's K1 fired; H6 reads only a portability record whose
  digests re-derive from these certs (it cannot show the other column came from another machine, and says
  so). The stranger command accounts for every scorecard, always runs the checkout step, FAILS drawn certs
  without fingerprints, and takes the seal's beacon from the seals step. The runner refuses a shadowed
  checksum module, untracked files under `styxx/`, an unanswered git status, and any beacon but the one
  `clock verify` prints ANCHORED for the seal.
- **The runner refuses the sealed experiment** unless the PREREG at HEAD is the sealed blob on a clean
  commit, and records the weights' Hub revision (0fae8ac7).
- **Sand survey pass 3's inputs were not in the tree.** The four reader returns and the fetch script are
  committed; the record rebuilds from them exactly except the quote check, whose texts are other people's
  work and stay out. `CORRECTION_sand_neighbours_pass3_2026_09_14.md` prices the fingerprint clause under
  four readings of the two terms the protocol left undefined: it retires under none, and ChatLog carries
  the clause's object under one of them and not its log-probabilities. The ERRATUM beside it (sworn) corrects what the correction then said about the margin: it is per source — log-probabilities against ChatLog and Hooker et al., a floor measured on the same weights against Xu et al., a self-comparison against Madaan et al. under the most lenient reading; no single element carries it.

**2026-09-14, on the same branch — CI made green, the next PREREG, the sentence priced a third time,
the reading rules as code, and a command for the stranger.**
- **CI had been red on Linux since the series landed**: an unused `sys` import in `styxx/geoplate.py`
  stopped every job at lint; then `str | None` annotations in `plate.py`/`geoplate.py` broke 3.9 at
  collection. Fixed; `pyproject` selects ruff FA102 so that class fails on Windows too; the challenge
  tests skip on a shallow clone with the reason. Green at 9f09e749; the stranger's first push (dee0d332 and ee96cb97) went red again on the repo's own subprocess-encoding test, fixed in 7213c6c4 (an earlier version of this line said green "every push since", which was not true).
- **`PREREG_checksum_beacon_draw_2026_09_14.md`** (frozen at b8205b1c, blob `d6a98261…` = anchor #6):
  48 canaries drawn from the 778-item pool by the block hash of the slot of the earliest confirmed
  memo carrying the file's digest, so the SELECTION of the 48 cannot precede its seal (this line first said "the run cannot precede its seal"; the per-item values over the public pool can be computed beforehand, and CORRECTION_prereg_beacon_draw_2026_09_14.md withdraws the claim); H1 in the held-out form the
  CORRECTION promised; K5 validity; K6 no ANCHORED line, no run. Sworn (24 spans), charon line 250.
  `run_deploy_quant.py --prereg {deploy_quant,beacon_draw}`; a second 0.5B check through the new
  path was bit-identical to the first. A test pins `styxx.beacon.POOL` to the frozen hash and size.
- **Sand survey pass 3** (`SURVEY_sand_neighbours_pass3_2026_09_14.md`, sworn, charon line 251):
  seventeen of pass 2's forty leads, closed by a protocol before any fetch, all read end to end;
  none retires a clause; three nearer neighbours (Tu et al., Hooker et al., Madaan et al.) enter the
  fingerprint clause; the licensed sentence is longer, not shorter. Every verdict quote was found
  verbatim in the extracted text by the builder.
- **`papers/checksum/score.py`**: the two PREREGs' hypotheses and kill gates executed by code on a
  certs file — predicted band, observed value, holds, per clause; INSTRUMENT CHECK vs result; K5
  re-derives the draw and checks the beacon against the ANCHORED line's. `tests/test_checksum_score.py`
  binds every band to the frozen text. On the 0.5B hand-set check it reads H1 FAILED (0 is not > 0)
  and H2 FAILED (0.427 above the band written for 1.5B) — by code, not by the author of the bands.
- **`styxx.stranger`** (`python -m styxx.stranger --repo . --expect-head <head>`): the seven checks
  of `papers/checksum/STRANGER.md` as one command with one table and an exit code. Its first run
  taught it which file to hand the verifier: `sworn check` must be given the `.sworn.json` sidecar
  (the commit and the manifest binding), not the `.md` — handed the `.md`, nine receipts whose spans (this line first said three)
  cite a harness manifest read FAILED; handed the sidecar, every checkable receipt in the tree
  VERIFIES (46 of 46), and the sworn-action samples (targets not in the tree) are reported as not
  checkable rather than failed.
- **The recipe does not reproduce the RESULT's magnitudes on a second machine; the verdicts do.**
  `NOTE_replication_alienware_2026_09_13.md` (sworn to both machines' bytes): the null pair at
  exactly 0 and 30 top-1 hits on both; int8 1.51 → 1.41 nats/token, random 9.50 → 9.72; the float32
  forward pass differs by at most 1.7e-5 nats/item across the machines, the int8 kernels and the
  seed-343 init do not transfer. `BOUNTY.md` gains the tolerance rule this forced.
- **`styxx.clock` checked nothing about who sealed**: a failed transaction, a memo from any wallet, a
  memo-only transaction and a null block time all read ANCHORED, and it handed `styxx.beacon` a
  base58 blockhash that `select` refused as non-hex — no draw could be made from any real seal.
  Thirteen named statuses, the fee payer must be the creator, the transaction must carry a transfer
  of the mint, the beacon is the blockhash's 32 bytes as hex, and the docstring says what is still
  not checked (one RPC trusted; no search for other memos, so the earliest-memo rule is owed — it was built the same night, 6db98505, and tightened on 2026-09-14, 7ef0e7ac).
- **`styxx.challenge` paid, by BOUNTY's letter, for a shallow clone, a renamed copy and a modified
  verifier.** v1 refuses all three with the reason, splits `agree` into digest and verdict, writes
  the stranger's receipt beside the record, and says what a record is: a self-report the lab
  settles by re-running. The sentence "cannot be edited afterwards" is gone from SAND_CHECK.
- **`styxx.checksum`**: the floor was silently promoted to 1e-4 (cert now carries measured and
  effective); the degeneracy guard ignored the belief geometry; a non-finite floor read SAME; an
  empty tokenizer compared; a top-k fingerprint compared with a full one (fingerprints carry `kind`
  and `k`); the cert digest covered no hash of either fingerprint (`compare/v1` does, plus the
  seed and floors); an INCONCLUSIVE cert was not strict JSON; `-0.0` on a noisy diagonal hashed
  by machine. Committed v0 certs stay under their schema.
- **`styxx.observatory` verify() re-derived nothing but linkage**: a forward-rehashed forgery of
  every verdict, a truncated log and a replaced plate all verified; the logged coefficient hashes
  never matched the files; the "three-day" demo was thirty-six seconds with caller-supplied dates.
  v1 re-derives coefficients and verdicts from the files a stranger has, pins head and count,
  writes `taken` beside `when`, refuses an empty rebaseline reason; the v0 demo fails v1 by
  design (`observatory_demo/CORRECTION.md`); a fresh demo lives under `observatory_demo_v1/`.
- **The deploy-scale runner** imported whichever styxx `sys.path` found and recorded nothing about
  it; it now refuses a package from outside the checkout, evaluates the PREREG's K1 in code,
  passes `n_boot` and `seed` explicitly, and writes provenance (git HEAD, the PREREG blob's
  sha256 — the sealed bytes — the checksum.py hash, versions, device, `CUBLAS_WORKSPACE_CONFIG`).
  H1 cannot read SAME by construction whenever its own first clause holds:
  `CORRECTION_prereg_deploy_quant_H1_2026_09_13.md` states the reading rule before the run, with
  a committed probe. `SEALS_2026_09_13.md` puts the frozen blob digests in the tree and states that
  a seal hashes the git blob, never the working copy (the runbook's instruction would have sealed a
  CRLF hash).
- **The browser plate drew the vertical mirror** of the python plate for every asymmetric figure;
  fixed, and `tests/test_plate_page.py` runs the page's own script under node against
  `styxx.plate`. "Byte-identical on any machine" was false for the PNGs (pixel-identical for the
  hash plate; the geometry plate's sand seed reads the unrounded floats) and for the last digits of
  r in the agreement json; the coefficient hashes are the cross-machine target, as SAND_CHECK said.
  SAND_CHECK §1 no longer says the lines are the digest: about 2^23 mode captions stand for 2^256.
- **`styxx.beacon`** accepted any hex string (now 64 characters only), its pool hash was pinned
  nowhere (now in a test), and its docstring said the beacon rode in every cert (it rides in none;
  owed). `styxx.epoch` refuses a salt that is not 32 bytes and says no epoch exists.
- **History**: the checksum RESULT's receipt named c1751053, a commit only the build machine had,
  for two commits of history; `tests/test_receipts_name_reachable_commits.py` makes that a CI
  failure (eight Action samples are the documented exception). The RESULT was re-sworn at 60fad45c
  and entered Charon as line 244 (`python -m styxx.charon ingest`; `build_log.py` refuses to
  rewrite a log, by design). INDEX says "seal pending", because no anchor exists in bytes.
- **The runner exercised on both paths, tagged so a check is never the experiment.** `--tag` marks
  an instrument check and an untagged run on any model but the PREREG's is refused. CPU smoke ran end
  to end (outputs gitignored by the repo's rule). GPU dry run on Qwen2.5-0.5B, committed as
  `deploy_quant_*_dryrun_qwen0.5b.*` with `is_the_experiment: false`: bitsandbytes NF4 and LLM.int8
  load on the RTX 4070 under Windows; three bf16 loads bit-identical (floor 0.000000, K1 silent);
  NF4 DRIFT 0.427 (r 0.960), int8 DRIFT 0.101 (r 0.996), random 10.44 (r 0.111). With a floor of
  exactly zero, the PREREG's H1 first clause ("> 0") fails by the letter; the CORRECTION's rule 1
  says how the RESULT reports that.
- **The second wave red-teamed, and the skimmed papers read (night).** Twelve agents, none refuted.
  `styxx.portability` v0 read an absent number as survived, let the base arm choose the verdict, digested the
  labels and not the inputs; v1 (`styxx.portability/v1`) refuses or names each, grades with the same mean
  statistic as `checksum.null_floor`, and never grades a bootstrap interval; `CORRECTION_portability`
  withdraws the RESULT's inside-means-replicated reading (a challenge is decided at the verdict level).
  A draw record is re-derived, never trusted: `checksum.check_draw_record` re-runs the beacon against the
  committed pool (a record with an honest canary hash and a lying beacon was accepted for a few hours);
  certs are `compare/v2` with the draw inside the digest; the observatory writes the draw into every chained
  line, refuses a baseline under another draw, and leaves no orphan fingerprint file; the runner refuses a
  malformed or untagged beacon before it imports torch. The static-embedding recipe pins its Hub revision and
  hashes the table; its random row is declared unrecipe'd. **The sand survey, pass 2**: the nine skimmed papers
  read end to end — Perrig and Song retire the face clause (hash visualization is defined over any bit-string,
  with a visual checksum of downloads as an application), Haber and Stornetta retire the seal clause a second
  time (sections 5–6 remove the trusted party), proof-of-learning moves to occupying the fingerprint clause,
  and Chen, Zaharia and Zou turn out to grade drift against a repeat-run floor after all. The licensed sentence
  has four clauses now, each with its neighbour named inside it; the earlier sworn survey stands as the record
  of what a skim licensed. Forty leads recorded for the next list. The fetch record is committed.
- **Two things the tree still lacks, named rather than hidden.** The 2026-09-12 sworn chat update
  that the entry below cites (and that `papers/plates/plate_receipt_update_2026_09_12.png` was
  rendered from) is not in the tree; the plate is unbacked until the triple is committed under
  `papers/chat/`. And the eight new modules are `python -m styxx.<module>` entry points outside
  the guarded public surface (`tests/test_public_surface.py` tests a hand-written list and
  `styxx/__init__.py` exports none of them); the `styxx[plate]` extra serves modules the CLI does
  not register.

## [Unreleased] — checksum v0: a fingerprint for model behavior, the observatory, the clock, the challenge record, the bounty

**`styxx/checksum.py`, `styxx/observatory.py`, `styxx/beacon.py`, `styxx/epoch.py`,
`styxx/clock.py`, `styxx/challenge.py`; `papers/checksum/`; `BOUNTY.md`;
`papers/plates/SAND_CHECK.md`. Nothing here is a measurement beyond one 135M model on cpu.**
This entry was missing from the series as built (the red team's hygiene reviewer found ten of
eleven commits absent from this file) and is written after the fact from the commits themselves.
- **`styxx.checksum`** fingerprints a model on a hashed 48-item canary set in teacher-forced
  log-probabilities, compares two fingerprints with a bootstrap interval, a degeneracy guard and a
  measured null floor, and writes a comparison cert. The sworn
  `RESULT_checksum_smollm_quant_2026_09_13.md`: the same weights reloaded read SAME at exactly 0
  nats/token, per-tensor int8 read DRIFT at 1.51 [1.17, 1.90] with belief-geometry r 0.83, random
  weights 9.50 — on one 135M model, on cpu, on the machine that ran it (see the entry above for
  what a second machine read).
- **`PREREG_checksum_deploy_quant_2026_09_13.md`** freezes the deploy-scale run (Qwen2.5-1.5B,
  bf16 vs NF4 vs int8, four hypotheses, four kill gates) before any data; `run_deploy_quant.py`
  is its runner. Unrun; seal pending.
- **`styxx.observatory`**: a chained daily log of fingerprints with a baseline that moves only by
  a reasoned rebaseline entry; `styxx.beacon`: a canary draw from a 778-item pool by a block hash;
  `styxx.epoch`: a salted commitment to a private canary set (primitive only; no epoch exists);
  `styxx.clock`: the memo builder and on-chain re-verification of anchors; `styxx.challenge`: the
  record a stranger files to replicate or challenge a sworn document.
- **`BOUNTY.md`** (rules v0, amounts unfilled) and **`SAND_CHECK.md`** (three ways in) — the
  holder-facing procedure; and `DUE_DILIGENCE_2026_09_13.md`, the series' own adversarial read.

## [Unreleased] — the plate: a receipt gets a face, a geometry gets a face, and neither can lie about the number

**`styxx/plate.py`, `styxx/geoplate.py`, `tests/test_plate.py`, `papers/plates/`,
`papers/disjoint-worlds/geometry_plates_demo.py`, `papers/charon/gallery.py`. Extra: `styxx[plate]`
(matplotlib, scipy). Nothing here is a measurement; every line below is a property of a picture.**
The survey `papers/frequency-resonance/SURVEY_frequency_vibration_2500yr_2026_06_04.md` ends by asking
for an instrument that does to claims what Chladni's plate did to sound. This is that sentence built.
- **`python -m styxx.plate <sha256>` renders a hash as a Chladni figure** — the nodal set of four
  square-plate modes chosen by the re-hashed digest, drawn as sand. Same digest, byte-identical
  picture on any machine; one changed hex character anywhere, a different figure
  (`papers/plates/plate_receipt_one_hex_changed.png` is the control). It is a picture of the
  number and says nothing about the document the number came from.
- **`styxx.geoplate` renders a matrix, not a hash, and is continuous**: the low-frequency 2-D DCT
  block (K=8) of a representational dissimilarity matrix over a fixed item order drives the plate,
  the always-zero diagonal removed first so it cannot make unrelated matrices look alike. Run on
  the four committed `disjoint-worlds` banks (462 concepts), the RDMs agree at 0.942 / 0.959 /
  0.929 across meta and google and 0.871–0.878 with qwen, a shuffled-item control at 0.001–0.004,
  and `papers/plates/geometry_plates_four_models.png` is those numbers as sand. The demo rebuilds
  it byte-for-byte from a clone with no GPU, no download and no torch. The picture cannot make
  two geometries agree more than the printed r says they do; `tests/test_plate.py` pins that a
  shuffled control separates while a perturbed copy stays close.
- **`papers/charon/gallery.py` renders every Charon line as a plate** keyed by its `entry_id`, so
  a changed line moves its own sand and every plate after it; `papers/plates/charon/charon_head.png`
  is the head at 243 lines.
- **Two debts paid while here.** `bench/tasks/reasoning.jsonl` reas-021: the gold answer is
  Tuesday, as stacc reported on 2026-09-02; the sworn update of 2026-09-12 swears it still read
  Wednesday at 4dba3a7, which stays true at that commit. `REPLICATE_legibility.md` said
  `pip install numpy scipy`; a cold clone on 2026-09-12 failed on line one because `run_g0clear.py`
  imports torch for the concept list. torch is now on the line. The same cold clone reproduced
  `b45_result.json` byte-identical in 2 s of compute.

## [Unreleased] — `--pr`: a public pull request gated by URL, no checkout

`python -m styxx.diffgate --pr https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/pull/N` reads the description and
the unified diff from api.github.com and hands them to `gate_diff_text` — the same two documents,
the same call and the same verdict as the GitHub Action, now from a terminal with nothing cloned.
`SUMMARY` given alongside replaces the fetched description; `--evidence` / `--commit` pass through
unchanged; `--run` is refused, because there is no checkout to run in and it would be someone
else's branch. A 404, a used-up rate limit (60 an hour unauthenticated; `GITHUB_TOKEN` /
`GH_TOKEN` is honoured) and a diff too large for the API each exit 2 with one plain sentence
instead of a traceback, and an empty description is said out loud rather than passed in silence.
Verdict logic is untouched: this is a third door into `_gate`, not a change to what happens inside
it. `tests/test_diffgate_pr.py` fakes the network at the one seam `fetch_pr` exposes, so the suite
still runs without one.

## [Unreleased] — prior-art survey: the sentence the plan held back is priced against nineteen fetches

**`papers/sworn/SURVEY_sworn_neighbours_2026_09_05.md`, run against the procedure frozen three
days earlier in `papers/sworn/PROTOCOL_sworn_prior_art_2026_09_02.md`, which named its nineteen
sources, its seven clauses, its question list and its outcome table before anything was fetched.**
Leg 3, item 6 of `papers/PLAN_the_next_level_2026_09_02.md`. It discharges owed item 5 of
`SPEC_sworn_output_v02_2026_09_02.md`, the same line in `RESULT_sworn_v02_ships_2026_09_02.md`,
and the entry this file has carried since v0.1: *the prior-art survey before any "we know of no
other"*.
- **Every source was read, none was skimmed, none was unfetchable.** Nineteen of nineteen, each
  with the URLs as fetched, the time of the fetch and the sha256 of the page bytes saved from it,
  in `papers/sworn/sworn_prior_art_survey.json`. Two readings the 2026-08-26 OATH survey left owed
  are done: arXiv 2606.27934 in full rather than from its abstract, and arXiv 2509.06902 under a
  frozen procedure rather than from a one-afternoon pilot. Both identifiers the procedure asked to
  verify resolve, and the one the list named only by topic is recorded under the title arXiv
  reports.
- **No clause was retired and none came back free.** All six are OCCUPIED, so each survives only
  with a neighbour named beside it, and the surviving sentence is written verbatim in the survey
  with the companion paragraph rule 4 requires it to travel with.
- **The two clauses the plan named no occupant for both have occupants.** C2PA carries
  `manifest.unknownProvenance` for content with no manifest and Proof-Carrying Certificates for LLM
  Pipelines reports an Abstain verdict on an assurance card; Deterministic Integrity Gates prints
  an untraced share, honest-signal states row by row what its gate does not cover, and a Registered
  Report puts every unregistered analysis in a section named as such.
- **Two sources come within one clause of the whole conjunction.** Deterministic Integrity Gates
  does everything but the distinct verdict for a document that bound nothing; Proof-Carrying
  Certificates does everything but the free-text host, which it declines on purpose. Nothing read
  does all six.
- **The clause about binding whole sentences survives on one word.** Two sources reach sentences of
  a free-text report — one extracts claims by script, one segments and judges with a model — and
  neither binds, so under the frozen rule neither can retire the clause. The survey says so instead
  of letting the word work quietly.
- **The reproducible-report family scores silent on the kinds clause, not occupied.** An inline
  value in knitr, Sweave, Quarto or MyST-NB is substituted rather than compared, so nothing can
  disagree with it and there is no verdict to report.
- **A dated errata is appended to the frozen procedure**, editing nothing above it: the survey's
  filename, the actual title of one source, the two planned URLs that served this agent a 403 and a
  client-rendered shell, the digest-of-fetched-bytes field the receipt adds, and the
  extract-versus-bind distinction that decided every cell of the sentences clause.
- **What it does not say.** That the sentence is true. Nineteen named sources are not the
  literature; the survey was run by one agent in one pass with no independent re-fetch, unlike the
  OATH survey; the rows are authored and the script only checks their shape and derives the
  statuses from the frozen tables. It ranks no one, and credits by name every neighbour that built
  a piece of this before this lab did.
- **Owed, unchanged and restated:** a human-reviewed pass before any of it goes outward; an
  independent re-fetch of the nineteen; a frozen procedure for the two conjunctions this one did
  not price, the diffgate sentence and the capsule sentence; and the v0.1 second-question sentence,
  priced properly or retired.
- **Two things the suite was saying about the machine rather than the repository, both found by
  building this leg, both fixed here.** A subprocess that dies having written nothing is not a
  digest that moved: the conformance regeneration check spawns a pytest run, and under this box's
  memory pressure that child produced no output at all while the assertion reported it as though
  the committed vector set had drifted. It now names a spawn failure with its exit code and the
  bytes each stream produced, and skips; only a refusal the tool actually printed is a drift. And
  a guard's population is what the repository is, not what a glob matched on one machine: the
  release ceiling guard walked the filesystem, so a git-ignored release bundle sitting in one
  checkout failed it while CI, which clones, passed. It now intersects with `git ls-files`, proved
  in both directions before shipping — an ignored file carrying a bare figure no longer fails the
  guard, and the same file, tracked, still does. Nine other test files still define a population
  by walking the tree; they are owed, not swept.

- **The differential is now a standing guard, and the frozen spec's D3 promise is finally kept.**
  The 150000-case run shipped with no test behind it at all, while D3 had committed to one. What is
  worth having is not a re-read of the published number but that every future edit to either
  implementation gets differentially tested before it lands: `tests/test_differential_agreement.py`
  runs 5000 live cases through both shipped verifiers on a seed the recorded run never touched and
  demands zero disagreements, with its own vocabulary check so it cannot rot into fuzzing the lexer
  while still passing. At ~1000 cases a second the guard can afford to be real.
- **Two suite repairs this leg turned up.** The differential receipt was named
  `differential_agreement_result.json`, and in this corpus `*_result*.json` is not a word meaning
  "output" but a type: `test_protocol_v2v3` sweeps that glob, finds each file's prereg, re-scores it
  through `Experiment` and asserts the stored verdict still holds. This receipt has no prereg and
  nothing scores it, so it may not wear that name; it is `differential_agreement.json`, moved as a
  100% rename with an identical sha256, and the frozen spec's D6 mention is corrected by a dated
  erratum appended rather than a silent edit. And **a child that never ran is not a package surface
  that changed**: the doctrine test that spawns a clean interpreter to ask whether importing styxx
  drags `sworn` in compared its stdout to "False" without checking the child ran, so a process
  killed under load reported a doctrine violation that did not happen. It is the third face of
  SKEW-is-not-DRIFT. A sweep found exactly one such place in the whole suite; it is fixed, and
  silence is now read as neither answer.

## [Unreleased] — withdrawn: the verdict was a decision, not a defect

- **WITHDRAWN: `SWORN-HELD` ignoring `UNRESOLVED` is a deliberate, documented decision.**
  `RESULT_sidecar_battery` proposed that `SWORN-HELD` should require `UNRESOLVED == 0` and left the
  rename operator-gated. Preparing that rename found the error: `tests/test_sworn.py` carries
  `test_unresolved_only_is_held_and_the_count_travels_in_the_headline`, and `_resolve`'s
  `rung_unknown` branch states the rationale — *"The verifier declines to see it; it accuses
  nobody."* `SWORN-FAILED` means the verifier CAUGHT something wrong; `UNRESOLVED` means it COULD
  NOT LOOK, and refusing to conflate them is the same principle as SKEW-is-not-DRIFT. The doctrine
  line the RESULT quoted governs `sworn_total == 0`, not unresolution. An erratum is appended to the
  sworn RESULT; the frozen text is not edited.
- **Also withdrawn: the rung-flip as an attack on the format.** The demonstration stands but requires
  control of the manifest, which `Manifest`'s docstring already declares a trust boundary.
- **What stands: the reader-facing hazard**, which is not about attackers — `verify --repo .` without
  `--commit` gives an honest user SWORN-HELD over a document where nothing was checked. The headline
  warning already shipped is the correct and sufficient repair; no vocabulary change is needed. The
  49 attacks, the 0 refusals, the `load_sidecar`/`render` round-trip gap and the rounding floor are
  unaffected.
- Measured before deciding: **68 of 2067 core vectors** would have moved under the rename — the
  corpus stating, 68 times, a behaviour it had already decided on.

## [Unreleased] — the short-needle exemption is earned by narrowing, not by naming a range

**Built to `papers/sworn/SPEC_short_needle_anchor_v01_2026_09_06.md`, frozen before the repair.**
From the sidecar battery's adversary, in its list of what nobody had attacked.

- **The exemption was keyed on whether a line slice was PRESENT, not on whether it NARROWED.**
  v0.2 R3 refuses a quote needle under 16 bytes over a whole receipt and exempts a line slice on the
  stated ground that "the author narrowed the haystack by naming it". `#L1-L3` over a three-line
  receipt is the whole receipt with an anchor on it — nothing narrowed, floor gone, a two-byte
  needle HELD. The adversary's example (`#L1-L400`) was wrong, refused as out of range; the claim
  under it held with a range that exactly spans the file.
- **The first repair was wrong, and the frozen spec that prescribed it was wrong the same way.** N1
  said compare bytes, not line counts. `_line_slice` excludes the last selected line's terminating
  LF by design, so a full-range slice of a 53-byte receipt is 52 bytes and a length test calls that
  narrowed; the guard still failed on the newline-terminated receipt. An **ERRATA is appended** to
  the frozen spec, never an edit. The repair that holds asks the slicer itself — a slice narrows iff
  it differs from `_line_slice(receipt, 1, n_lines)` — and the JavaScript side asks `lineSlice` the
  same question (N5).
- **Watched to fail and re-derived from git**: 2 of 8 failed against the shipped verifier (both
  whole-receipt slices, terminated and unterminated), 0 of 8 after; the 6 that pass throughout are
  the controls — the bare floor, one line of three, two of three, a needle absent from the named
  line, a pointer leaf, a needle at the floor. `papers/sworn/repair_receipt.py` (NEW, generalised
  from the tree-channel one) runs the guard at the repair commit and its parent with BOTH verifiers
  taken from git, so a two-sided repair is never measured with one side old and one side new.
- The frozen 1689-vector bar holds; the standing differential guard passes with both sides changed
  together.
- **Not reproduced as described:** `commit: null` blinding the tree channel. With an explicit tree
  handle it resolves; only the CLI path without `--commit` goes blind, which is the UNRESOLVED
  finding already warned about in #71.
## [Unreleased] — invariant 2 on the tree channel: one refusal on every form a receipt can take

**Built to `papers/sworn/SPEC_tree_channel_authorship_v01_2026_09_06.md`, frozen before the
repair.** From the sidecar battery's adversary, in its list of what nobody had attacked.

- **The invariant — the agent cannot swear to bytes it minted — was enforced on one channel of
  three.** `_resolve` refused a receipt whose sha256 the manifest lists in `authored_sha256` on the
  `rN` branch, at one line. The tree branch — `path:` and `prereg:` — computed the same digest from
  the resolved bytes and never compared it to anything. Same bytes, same manifest, confirmed by
  execution: `rN` MALFORMED `receipt_author_minted`; `path:` **HELD**; `prereg:` **HELD**; and
  `absent` — the verdict that says *this never happened* — **HELD** over the author's own committed
  file by naming it instead of citing it.
- **The repair is one comparison**, with the existing reason string. `complete = True` stays on the
  tree branch: a committed blob is complete, and the defect was never completeness — it was assuming
  completeness before checking authorship.
- **Watched to fail, and re-derived from git rather than remembered.** The guard was written first:
  3 of 10 failed against the shipped verifier (`path`, `prereg`, `absent`-by-path), 0 of 10 after.
  The 7 that pass in both states give the repair its shape — the `rN` refusal unchanged, an honest
  committed file still resolving, `absent` still holding over it, an empty list refusing nothing — so
  a repair that refused every tree receipt would have failed them. `tree_channel_repair_receipt.py`
  reads the verifier at the repair commit and its parent and runs the guard against each in a
  scratch copy, so the RESULT's numbers bind to a receipt anyone can regenerate.
- **The conformance set regenerated with no moved core**, which says it never exercised this case
  either — consistent with the tree layer measuring 4 of 14 in the suite-power leg. The frozen 1689
  bar holds; the JavaScript verifier has no tree channel and is untouched.
- **Stated rather than solved:** the tree channel has no `kind_of_source`, so the other half of the
  `rN` refusal has no analogue there. A file the agent committed under a name the harness never
  digested is still not caught. That is a limit of the manifest.

## [Unreleased] — the sidecar battery: 49 attacks, 0 refused, and a verdict that means less than its name

**Built to `papers/sworn/SPEC_sidecar_battery_v01_2026_09_06.md`, frozen before the battery was
written.** The suite-power study measured the sidecar layer at 6 killed of 13 with both injection
boundaries undefended — a statement about the tests. This asked the question about the code: is
there an attack? Six attackers took a surface each, an adversary hunted what they left alone, and
every prediction was recorded before anything ran.

- **49 attacks ran and `load_sidecar` refused none of them.** Self-minted manifests, transplanted
  identities, forged commits, smuggled tags, receipt entries whose shape `Manifest.add()` would
  reject — all accepted. It is genuinely strict, but strict about SHAPE, and none of these were the
  wrong shape. It never crashed either: 0 attacks produced anything but a clean accept or refuse,
  which is the promise its docstring makes.
- **10 succeeded by the frozen criterion** — accepted, and the rendered document does not
  re-canonise to the span table that was validated. `to_sidecar` refuses to emit a sidecar that
  cannot round-trip; `load_sidecar` + `render` makes no such promise in the other direction, and
  `text_smuggling` broke it 5 times of 7.
- **42 of the 49 render to a document that verifies SWORN-HELD, and 14 of those hold nothing at
  all.**
- **THE FINDING, and it is not in the sidecar layer.** The ladder reads
  `elif counts["FAILED"] == 0 and counts["MALFORMED"] == 0: SWORN-HELD` and never consults
  `UNRESOLVED`. A document in which nothing was checked carries the same headline as one in which
  everything held — the conflation this module's own doctrine refuses four lines from the top of the
  same file ("a document that swore nothing is UNSWORN, never 'no failures'"), applied to
  `sworn_total == 0` and not to `unresolved == sworn_total`.
- **Author-reachable with one string.** A manifest rung the verifier does not know makes every span
  UNRESOLVED with reason `rung_unknown`, before the receipt id is looked up. Same document, same
  receipt, a sentence saying the loss is 0 against a receipt saying 4200000: rung `L2` gives
  SWORN-FAILED, rung `L3` gives **SWORN-HELD**. Nothing forged, nothing malformed.
- **It catches honest documents, which is how it was found.** Verifying a real committed RESULT with
  `--repo .` and no `--commit` resolves nothing: held=0, unresolved=10, SWORN-HELD. With the commit
  its sidecar names: held=10. Both print SWORN-HELD. That is not an exotic attack, it is the
  ordinary way a reader runs the tool.
- **Repaired: the headline warns**, distinguishing *nothing was checked* from *N of M did not hold*,
  and the guard is watched to fail — remove the warning and 3 of its 6 tests fail, with two silence
  controls so it does not become noise.
- **NOT repaired, and left to the operator:** renaming the verdict. `SWORN-HELD` should require
  `UNRESOLVED == 0`. That is a breaking change to a published vocabulary every consumer of
  `document_verdict` depends on. The blast radius was measured rather than guessed: of 39 committed
  sworn receipts, ONE is SWORN-HELD with unresolved spans, and it is a fixture named
  `sworn_action_sample.UNRESOLVED`.
- **A second action sample, beside the first.** The committed sample contained exactly that case, so
  it stopped reproducing. The script's own refusal already named the remedy — "a sample is history;
  write a new prefix at a new commit" — and had no way to do it, so `--prefix` was added.
  `sworn_action_sample.*` stays untouched history; `sworn_action_sample_2026_09_06.*` is what the
  action prints now. **The two summaries differ in exactly one line**, and a test pins that, because
  the pair is the record of the change.
- **A second finding: the rounding rule has no floor.** `DECISIONS["rounding"]` quantizes the
  receipt to the fractional digits **the author printed**, which is right — demanding an exact match
  would FAIL every honestly rounded figure. But at zero fractional digits it stops rounding and
  starts erasing: a receipt of `0.4211` against the sentence "the A-share is 0." is **HELD**, with a
  genuine harness-minted L2 receipt and nothing malformed. The verdict is deliberately unchanged;
  the headline now counts spans whose non-zero receipt was compared against zero, and a receipt
  genuinely equal to zero is not flagged, which is the control.
- **The first attempt at that signal was itself a defect, and the corpus refused it.** It added a
  field to the span's `detail` — which is inside the digested core — so it moved the core digest of
  every affected span and would have put Python out of agreement with the JavaScript verifier. The
  conformance generator refused the regeneration outright: *"a moved core is a finding about the
  verifier, never a reason to rewrite the set"*. A warning that changes what the format digests is a
  format change wearing a warning's clothes. Derived on the headline instead, from fields `detail`
  already carried.
- **A repair to yesterday's repair.** The `canon` warning shipped hours earlier sliced `side["text"]`
  — a `str` — by BYTE offsets. It lines up only while a document stays ASCII and shifts silently
  otherwise; on this leg's own RESULT it read a span forty bytes away and reported "no digit-bearing
  token" for a span carrying two. Fixed, and pinned by a test whose document carries em-dashes.

## [Unreleased] — suite power: half the changes to the layers nothing can reach would ship green

**Built to `papers/sworn/SPEC_suite_power_v01_2026_09_06.md`, frozen before any mutant ran.** The
mutation study found six blind spots no generator can ever reach — the three tree handles, the
sidecar layer and the receipt layer — because the JavaScript verifier has no repository and those
layers sit outside the compared verdict core. The aperture leg then showed what a blind spot can
hide. Those layers have no second implementation anywhere, so the only instrument left is the test
suite, and nobody had measured what it would catch.

- **51 viable mutants, 25 killed, 26 survived — a kill rate of 0.4902.** Valid run: 0 controls
  killed, the unmutated oracle passes, all four layers represented, 0 anchors unmatched and 0
  mutants that would not load.
- **The weakest layer is the one that matters most.** coverage 8/11, receipt 7/13, sidecar 6/13,
  **tree 4/14 (28.6%)** — and `tree` carries the entire `UNRESOLVED` reason vocabulary.
- **Both sidecar injection boundaries survived.** `load_sidecar`'s tag-grammar guard on the
  `receipt` and `kind` attributes — which `render` interpolates straight back into document bytes —
  and the upper bound on a span's end offset, where Python's slicing clamps rather than raising.
  Both sit on the standalone `render` path where `verify()`'s re-scan reconciliation never runs.
  `GitTree._ready` accepting a non-commit object survived too, as did comparing the text-to-digest
  binding on a 12-character prefix.
- **Concentration, which a rate cannot show: 9 of the 25 kills rest on exactly one test and 20 rest
  on five or fewer.** The starkest is `verify_receipt reports VERIFIED on the digest alone` — the
  join to which the whole *trust neither the author nor the verifier* doctrine reduces — noticed by
  a single assertion.
- **`tests/test_sworn_dogfood.py` did 105 of the kills, more than any other file.** The lab's
  practice of swearing its own documents is its strongest single test.
- **Three agent-facing repairs, each paid for by a mistake made in this session rather than
  imagined.** `check` now prints the DOCUMENT's verdict beside the receipt's status, because
  VERIFIED and SWORN-HELD are one word apart and the first was read as the second. `canon` now warns
  when a numeric span carries the wrong number of digit-bearing tokens — a purely lexical rule it
  could always have checked, which cost three documents in one night, each canonised silently and
  only reported MALFORMED after the sidecar named a commit. And `tests/test_sworn.py` gains the
  fixture its own name promised.
- **What the two cap survivals taught, which is worth more than the fix.** The cap constant could be
  raised a thousandfold because the fixture is built as `MAX_RECEIPT_BYTES + 1` and rises with it —
  *a test whose fixture derives from the constant under test cannot detect a change to that
  constant.* And the size clause could be deleted because every fixture reached `receipt_too_large`
  through the `data is None` disjunct instead — *a test can be named for a behaviour, assert on it,
  pass, and never exercise the branch it is named for.* Neither is visible to line coverage; both
  lines execute either way.
- **A claim from the previous leg WITHDRAWN**, in `papers/sworn/OBSERVATION_gap_prediction_2026_09_06.md`.
  This lab said an agent reading the source predicted blind spots better than 150000 random cases
  could find them; that held at p=0.0011 against a differential harness and **did not replicate**
  against a test suite (p=0.173, pointing the other way but not significantly). The confound is
  stated: the critic was told to find what nobody had covered and could see the other proposals, so
  it was differentiating against a list rather than predicting from code alone.

## [Unreleased] — aperture closure: the blind spot was hiding two real defects, and one changed a verdict

**Built to `papers/sworn/SPEC_aperture_closure_v01_2026_09_05.md`, frozen before the generator was
touched.** The mutation study's most useful sentence — that 20 of its 29 misses would fall to a
stronger generator and 9 would not — was the one with no evidence behind it. This widened the
generator in exactly the places the taxonomy named, changing nothing about the comparison, to find
out whether the diagnosis was real. The answer arrived before any of the intended bookkeeping.

- **THE TWO IMPLEMENTATIONS DISAGREE.** Same seed, same 150000 cases, same `python_digest`,
  `js_digests`, core and exclusions — only what the generator can produce changed. Grammar v1: 0
  disagreements. Grammar v2: **712**. Of the 50 recorded in full, **5 change a verdict**, and one
  changes it in the direction that matters — the JavaScript verifier reported a span **HELD** that
  `styxx.sworn` reported **MALFORMED**. A sentence the reference implementation refuses to read at
  all, the browser verifier vouched for.
- **Defect 1: the JS decoders ate a leading BOM.** `new TextDecoder("utf-8", { fatal: true })`
  leaves `ignoreBOM` at `false`, which in WHATWG's inverted naming means the decoder *strips* a
  leading U+FEFF — so `jsonStrict`'s explicit BOM refusal was unreachable dead code on every bytes
  path, and a BOM-prefixed receipt payload held on one side and was refused on the other.
- **Defect 2: `safeText` destroyed astral characters.** Its lone-surrogate fixup matched
  `[\ud800-\udfff]`, a class spanning high *and* low surrogates, so for a valid pair the LOW half
  matched and was replaced: U+1F600 came out of every `detail.leaf` as a high surrogate plus U+FFFD.
  It also used the wrong replacement character (Python's encode-side `errors="replace"` emits `?`)
  and sliced by UTF-16 code units where Python slices by code points.
- **After both repairs, 0 of 150000 disagree** over 1169 HELD and 3347 FAILED spans, with an
  identical span census across all three runs. That zero and the first zero are the same number and
  not the same fact: the first described a generator, the second describes two implementations.
- **What no instrument here could see.** The conformance set passed identically before and after
  both repairs — 1689 ran, 1689 passed, 0 failed, every time. Twice in one session a clean
  instrument sat beside a live, verdict-changing divergence in the shipped file. A second vector set
  would not have helped, because the vectors and the differential shared the blind spot.
- **Both repairs are pinned by guards watched to fail**: `tests/test_sworn_bom_agreement.py` (2 of 5
  fail with the defect restored) and `tests/test_sworn_astral_agreement.py` (10 of 16). The astral
  file also records a boundary no repair can reconcile — Python holds two adjacent lone surrogates
  as two code points where a JavaScript UTF-16 string cannot tell them from one astral character.
- **A claim this leg made and then WITHDREW**, in `papers/sworn/NOTE_unpaired_samples_2026_09_06.md`.
  Commit `87581ccd` reported the widening had lowered the detection rate from 0.5857 to 0.5571 and
  offered dilution as the mechanism. The comparison does not support it: `case(seed, index)` draws
  from a seeded stream, every draw advances it, and the widening added draws — so of the first 500
  cases at the same seed **only 51 produce the same document under both grammars**. Two runs "at the
  same seed" were two samples from two distributions. **Any change to a seeded generator, including
  a purely additive one, changes every case the seed produces after the insertion point. Fixing the
  seed does not fix the sample.** The remedy — per-component RNG streams — is written down and
  deliberately not applied, because it would invalidate the receipts this leg just committed.
- The taxonomy's structural half held: three misses closed for the reason it gave, not by luck. The
  old generator emitted no manifest string containing a newline, never more than one
  `authored_sha256` element, and never an uppercase digest — those inputs existed at no case count.

## [Unreleased] — mutation coverage: the differential cannot see 29 of 70 changes, and 9 of those no fuzzing would have found

**`conformance/sworn/mutation_coverage.py` and `conformance/sworn/control_audit.py` (NEW), built to
`papers/sworn/SPEC_mutation_coverage_v01_2026_09_05.md`, frozen with its five gates before any
mutant ran.** "150000 agreements, zero disagreements" has two readings and the run cannot tell them
apart: the implementations agree, or the generator cannot reach where they differ. A differential
test with no measure of its own detection power is an instrument with no calibration, and this lab
withdrew a coverage estimate on 2026-09-02 for exactly that shape.
- **80 mutations, proposed by eight readers of both implementations who never saw the coverage,
  committed before the run.** 70 viable, 41 caught, 29 missed — a detection rate of 0.5857. The
  catalogue was clean: 0 anchors unmatched, 0 mutants that would not load, 0 degenerate.
- **The rate is the summary; the causes are the result.** 15 misses need an input the generator's
  ten payload literals cannot produce, 5 need a document shape the grammar does not compose, 6 are
  outside the compared surface entirely, 2 are unreachable by any input, and 1 is an equivalent
  mutant proved to change no behaviour at all. **20 would fall to a stronger generator; 9 would
  not.**
- **What the six say is the finding.** The JavaScript verifier has no repository, so every `path:`
  and `prereg:` receipt resolves on the Python side against nothing on the other: the whole
  tree-handle layer is compared against silence, and so are the sidecar and receipt layers, which
  sit outside the verdict core the digest covers. *The two implementations agree* was always a
  claim about a subset of each implementation, and until now nobody had said which subset. That is
  not a defect the differential introduced — it is a scope it always had and never stated.
- **Half-even rounding can be changed to half-up on EITHER side and nothing notices**, because a
  tie is only observable on a value sitting exactly at one at the printed precision and none of the
  ten payload literals produces one. The decimal region — the most numerically delicate rule in the
  format — caught 4 of 8.
- **An agent reading the source predicted the blind spots better than 150000 random cases could
  find them.** The completeness critic's ten additions, aimed at regions nobody had covered, scored
  1 of 10.
- **The first run is committed VOID.** G-K failed — a control was caught — and the frozen spec says
  that voids the run and it reports nothing about detection. It is in the tree unedited, because a
  study about instruments that flatter their builders does not discard its own failed attempt. The
  gate worked, but caught a *catalogue* defect: two of twelve claimed controls were mislabelled, in
  both directions of harm. Labels are no longer taken on trust — `control_audit.py` decides them
  from the edit, by a criterion fixed in advance and applied in both directions, and it needed
  three corrections of its own that are recorded rather than lost.
- **Marginality is published because the guard's size is a choice.** 4 of the 41 catches were
  caught by exactly ONE case in 5000, and 8 by five or fewer; a fifth-size guard would have been
  blind to most of them.

## [Unreleased] — differential agreement: 150,000 inputs nobody chose, and the two verifiers never once disagreed

**`conformance/sworn/differential.py` (NEW), built to
`papers/sworn/SPEC_differential_agreement_v01_2026_09_05.md`, frozen with its five gates and its
seed before any code existed.** The conformance set asks whether a second implementation agrees
where the lab looked; every one of its 1689 vectors was recorded from a call some author wrote, and
the JavaScript was repaired five times against those very vectors until it matched. A set you tuned
against cannot also be the set that measures you. This asks the other question.
- **The run: 150000 generated documents, both shipped verifiers, 150000 agreements, 0
  disagreements, and no input on which one side raised and the other did not.** Seed 20260905,
  named in the spec before the run; each case is a pure function of (seed, index), so a
  disagreement would travel as two integers.
- **The census beside the number, because agreement without it measures the generator.** 384717
  spans adjudicated — 346066 MALFORMED, 31486 UNRESOLVED, 5333 FAILED, 1832 HELD — with 38 distinct
  MALFORMED reasons against a bar of 12, both document-level refusals reached, and every kind
  exercised including the three the format refuses.
- **Neither side is instrumented.** The Python side is `styxx.sworn.verify` as installed, the
  JavaScript side is `styxx/_data/sworn_verify.js` as shipped, and the harness hashes what each
  returned and compares two hex strings. Node is spawned once per batch, not once per case.
- **What it does not say**, and the RESULT says it: that either implementation is correct. They
  agree, and agreement is not correctness — both may be wrong in the same way, and the same hands
  wrote both. What it removes is the weaker excuse, *they only agree where we looked*. The HELD
  path is under two percent of spans, which is the number a successor should raise first.

## [Unreleased] — leg 2: the sworn measurement's machinery, built and dry-run, with nothing run as a measurement

**`papers/sworn/measurement/` (NEW), built to `papers/sworn/SPEC_sworn_measurement_machinery_2026_09_05.md`,
which was frozen in its own commit before any of this code existed.** Leg 2 of
`papers/PLAN_the_next_level_2026_09_02.md`, to the bars of
`papers/sworn/DESIGN_sworn_measurement_v2_2026_09_02.md` — every one of them still proposed and
unsigned, and marked `proposed_unsigned` in every gate object the scorer writes.
- **The scorer is committed before any seat can speak.** `score.py` folds every gate as a function
  of committed inputs, obtains every verdict by calling the verifier or reading a committed
  receipt, and adjudicates no span itself. A scorer authored after seeing the answers is a scorer
  with a thumb on it.
- **The population is a script, the packets are blind, the keys are sealed.** `population.py`
  applies the design's rule mechanically at a pinned commit and lists what it excluded and why;
  `build_packets.py` writes items carrying opaque ids and nothing else, and seals the answer keys
  outside the tree, leaving only salted digests in `keys/`; `canaries.py` plants its twins into the
  sealed directory and commits their digests, never a twin.
- **Falsehood is established without the instrument under test.** A canary's receipt is shown not
  to hold what its sentence says with `Decimal` and `bytes.find` over git plumbing; the verifier
  is never asked. A canary the verifier reports MALFORMED or UNRESOLVED counts in the denominator
  and not the numerator: a planted falsehood it did not fail is a miss whatever the reason.
- **The seat runners refuse.** Neither `seat_claude.py` nor `seat_local.py` will read a document of
  this lab until `papers/sworn/PREREG_sworn_measurement_<date>.md` is tracked at HEAD and every key
  digest the packet names is committed. The refusal is a `SystemExit` whose message begins
  `REFUSED:`, and it is under test.
- **The dry run walks the paths that matter, on bytes it invented.**
  `papers/sworn/measurement/dryrun/` is committed whole: both families clearing one panel, one
  family built to miss the other so the void, the WITHHELD share and the one-family counts run,
  an answer the parser could not read, a bracket found only after whitespace collapse, and a
  canary planted to come back MALFORMED. Every share, interval, kappa and Q3 value it would print
  is replaced by a literal saying there is no rate. Its counts are sworn, and titled as machinery,
  in `papers/sworn/RESULT_measurement_machinery_dry_run_2026_09_05.md`.
- **Neither transport answered on this box, and that is recorded rather than smoothed.** The
  `claude -p` clean-config call returned its error envelope — the CLI reported an expired OAuth
  session — so the contamination probe came back empty and the runner did what it is built to do:
  wrote the seat file `VOID-CONTAM` with no items and read nothing. The local family could not be
  loaded at all: the design's model in bf16, its named fallback, and even a far smaller model each
  died during load, because another process on this box held most of its memory. Neither outcome
  is a seat, neither is in the tree, and the local substrate remains undecided.
- **A recorded reason is now this repository's own sentence.** Transport and substrate failures are
  classified by exception TYPE into a fixed phrase, never by quoting the exception's message: that
  text is CPython's and differs between 3.9 and 3.12, and a seat file is a committed artifact.

Owed, and recorded as owed: the preregistration commit — the operator's, never the builder's —
naming the signed bars, the pooled denominator for the canary gate, the local substrate, the
cross-family label rule, the model alias, and a lock hash over the scorer, the packets, the canary
digests and the key digests. Seats run after that commit and not before.

## [Unreleased] — the browser verifier v0.1: a second implementation agrees on every vector in scope

**`styxx/_data/sworn_verify.js` (NEW) and the capsule's sworn profile, built to
`papers/sworn/SPEC_sworn_browser_verifier_v01_2026_09_05.md`, frozen in its own commit with its
acceptance bar written down before any code existed.** Leg 3, item 5 of
`papers/PLAN_the_next_level_2026_09_02.md`. The label the plan writes is printed in the verifier,
in the capsule page and in this entry: *re-derives sworn span verdicts offline; a forger
controlling the whole file passes both browser layers; the package at the named commit is the
check.*
- **The conformance set has something held to it.** `conformance/sworn/replay_js.js` runs the
  JavaScript over the committed vectors and reports, per family, what it ran and what it skipped
  with the vector's own `requires` as the reason. **1689 vectors in scope, 1689 reproduce the
  verdict core digest, 0 disagree, 1929 skipped** (every mode but `inline`, and everything needing
  a git tree); 1452 of those run are the seeded fuzz corpus, uncapped. A test asserts the number
  run equals the number the spec froze, so a growing set fails rather than re-fitting the bar.
- **Five disagreements, all found by vectors and all repaired in the JavaScript** — never in
  `styxx/sworn.py`, which this leg does not touch: the class name Python prints for a parsed JSON
  object (`_Obj`); the two completeness rules for `absent`; a MALFORMED out of resolution carrying
  its provenance; a manifest read as plain JSON while receipt bytes are read decimal-exact; and
  the terminating newline of an `L`-anchor's last line.
- **The verifier is a pure function of bytes**: no I/O, no clock, no globals, no network, byte
  offsets over `Uint8Array` and never over string indices, and sha256 implemented in the file
  because `crypto.subtle` is async-only and a capsule layer must answer without a promise chain.
  `pyproject.toml` ships `*.js` from `styxx._data`.
- **The capsule's sworn profile** seals the document bytes, the manifest, the verdict receipt and
  the verifier's own bytes, written LF-only so the sealed copy and the copy the browser runs are
  byte-identical. It fails closed on five named refusals — `sworn_document_mismatch`,
  `sworn_tree_receipt`, `sworn_no_manifest`, `sworn_manifest_mismatch`, `sworn_receipt_mismatch` —
  and keeps INSTRUMENT SKEW apart from tamper. Layer 1 re-derives the portable core in the
  reader's browser; layer 2 re-runs `styxx.sworn` and is the one that checks the build the receipt
  names. The first sworn capsule is committed beside the document it seals.
- **The label is demonstrated, not asserted.** The tamper battery builds the forger it describes —
  a page whose inlined verifier quietly un-does the change made to the document — and shows layer 1
  believing it while layer 2 names the inlined copy as not the sealed one.
- **What it does not say:** that agreement makes either verifier correct (the same hands wrote
  both, and that is the objection to press); that the format is covered (1929 vectors are outside
  this subset); that `path:` receipts can be checked offline (they cannot, and the profile refuses
  to seal a document carrying one); that anything here is self-verifying.

## [Unreleased] — the sworn action v0.1: a runner mints the manifest after the turn, and exits zero on every verdict

**`sworn/` (NEW: `action.yml`, `sworn_action.py`, `README.md`, `examples/sworn.yml`), built to
`papers/sworn/SPEC_sworn_action_v01_2026_09_05.md`, frozen in its own commit before any code.**
Leg 3, item 4 of `papers/PLAN_the_next_level_2026_09_02.md`, under the plan's own label:
*report-only until the measurement prices FAILED*. A composite action in its own subdirectory —
the root `action.yml` stays diffgate's — that runs the project's own test command, mints a
`sworn/manifest/0.2` from the report and the event **after the turn** through
`styxx.harness.junit` and `styxx.harness.github`, verifies every sworn document the pull request
touched against it, and writes a job-summary table with the rung and the harness string on every
row.
- **Exit zero on every verdict.** The command's exit status is a record, never the job's; a
  contradicted span is reported and nothing is blocked, because a gate this lab has not measured
  is a gate this lab does not ship.
- **The composed receipt numbering is stated, not guessed:** `r1`–`r4` are the JUnit adapter's,
  `r5`–`r9` the GitHub adapter's shifted by four, and the README says what an author may cite
  before the runner has minted anything. A document citing an `rN` the runner never minted reads
  UNRESOLVED, not an error.
- **The fork sentence, printed into every manifest.** On a `pull_request` from a fork the minting
  job runs the workflow file as it exists in the head, so the manifest is minted by a party the
  claimant controls and the sentence L2 rests on does not hold; it holds for a workflow pinned to
  the base branch, or for a manifest attested outside the job. Every blob the turn added or
  modified at head enters `authored_sha256`, so a document swearing to bytes the turn itself wrote
  is MALFORMED rather than believed.
- **A committed sample run** (`sworn_action_sample.py` → `.run.json`, `.summary.md`, three
  receipts) drives the whole action over a temporary repository with no network: a held body, a
  five-span held document, a contradicted document read `SWORN-FAILED`, an unresolved citation,
  two files skipped with their reasons, and exit 0 throughout.
- **`tests/test_sworn_action.py`**: 35 tests over a fake event file, a fake report and canned
  documents — the summary table, the composed numbering, the fork refusals, a command that exits
  non-zero, a report that never appears.
- **The RESULT** (`RESULT_sworn_action_v01_ships_2026_09_05.md`, sworn, 16 spans) binds its counts
  to the sample run's leaves and its test counts to the manifest the JUnit adapter minted over the
  run of those tests.
- **What it does not say:** that the action has run on GitHub (no token in this lab can push a
  workflow file; the sample workflow is for the operator to copy and this repository enables
  nothing), that L2 has been verified (the rung is the workflow's declaration, printed, never
  checked), or that a held document is true.

## [Unreleased] — sworn conformance v0.1: the tests become bytes a second verifier can be held to

**`conformance/sworn/` (NEW) and `styxx.sworn.SnapshotTree` (NEW), built to
`papers/sworn/SPEC_sworn_conformance_vectors_v01_2026_09_05.md`, frozen in its own commit before
any code, with a dated ERRATA appended in the commit that carries the RESULT.** Leg 3, item 2 of
`papers/PLAN_the_next_level_2026_09_02.md`, under the plan's own label: *the precondition for any
second verifier; no claim*. Every call the two sworn test files make into `styxx.sworn` is
recorded as bytes — the document, the manifest, a tree snapshot with modes, the exact receipt
core the verdict must reproduce — and addressed by one digest, so that a verifier in another
language can be shown where it disagrees, byte by byte, before anyone is asked to trust it.
- **The pinned core follows the code, not the prose (C1).** `core_sha256 = sha256(utf8(jcs(core)))`
  over the verifier's output minus `verifier` minus `coverage`, `schema` and `format` included;
  the receipt's own `digest` is build-bound and is never a vector's number.
- **Six modes, inputs as bytes (C2).** `inline`, `sidecar`, `canon`, `load`, `manifest`,
  `receipt_check`; a manifest is `core()` plus its declared digest so a tampered digest replays;
  a tree is a snapshot taken after the call with the handle's own commit beside it.
- **The clock and the git dates are pinned (C3); the floor is pinned, the observer is not (C4).**
  `diff_claim_*` and `claimdetect_version` travel in `observer.json`, outside the digest.
- **Nothing is dropped silently (C5); a moved core refuses regeneration (C6).** The calls the set
  cannot carry are listed with their test ids; the reasons, verdicts and refusal codes no vector
  produces are listed; `gen_vectors.py` refuses a moved core or a nondeterministic id in the
  manner of `reissue_receipts_v1.py`, and `--check` regenerates to the committed digest or exits 1.
- **`styxx.sworn.SnapshotTree` (C10):** a tree snapshot with modes that reproduces every
  `GitTree` reason but `git_unavailable` without a git binary; pure, additive, beside
  `MemoryTree`. Git enters through `conformance/sworn/recorder.py` and nowhere in the verifier.
- **`tests/test_sworn_conformance.py`**, with nothing skipped: blobs hash to their keys, family
  files to their index entries, `set_sha256` re-derives, every id re-derives, every vector
  replays, every rule has both shapes, the closed sets are produced or listed, every file under
  `conformance/` is `-text` and CR-free, no file wears a suffix another sweep claims, and the
  committed set regenerates to its own digest.
- **The RESULT** (`RESULT_sworn_conformance_v01_ships_2026_09_05.md`, sworn) binds every count
  and the set digest to leaves of `conformance/sworn/index.json` at the commit that carries them;
  the set is never regenerated in place after it.
- **What it does not say:** that agreement on these vectors makes a verifier correct, that the
  vectors cover the format (they cover what two test files exercise, written by the builder),
  that the fuzz family is adversarial, or that any second verifier exists.
- **Owed, unchanged and restated:** a `committed` family from `tests/test_sworn_dogfood.py`; a
  `refusal` attribute on the verifier's `SystemExit` if a second verifier needs codes at the
  source; the `verdict_core()` split of `verify()`; the Python-versus-JavaScript semantics the
  vectors pin and item 5 must implement; the measurement, the prior-art survey, the harness
  adapters and a release, as before.
## [Unreleased] — receipt binding: a certificate names the bytes it swore to, and the audit says where those bytes went

**SPEC first: `papers/closed-model-frontier/SPEC_oath_receipt_binding_2026_09_04.md`, frozen
in its own commit before any code, with a dated ERRATA appended after the adversarial pass
(`ATTACKS_receipt_binding_battery_2026_09_05.md`: 52 constructions, 36 broke a sentence or a
rule, 12 of them in code, all repaired before this shipped).** Leg 3, item 1 of
`PLAN_the_next_level_2026_09_02.md` — the one ADVANCE the whole-program audit named. An OATH
certificate recorded each receipt's digest and then bound by *basename*, so a receipt
regenerated in place silently invalidated every certificate citing it — twice in two days
(2026-08-31 → 09-01) and once in June — and the audit could not tell *the receipt moved* from
*the certificate is wrong*. Now the certificate says which bytes it meant and the audit looks
for them, for the document as well as the receipts. No verdict moves; no certificate is re-issued.
- **`styxx.receipt_binding` (NEW)** — the one module that talks to git on a certificate's behalf,
  subprocess-only (no GitPython): content digests modulo newlines, the committed blob at HEAD,
  the five cells of SPEC R3 — `same`, `at_issue`, `elsewhere`, `unbacked`, `unrecoverable` —
  decided by digest in the working tree at the repository root, then against the tree at the
  certificate's issuing commit, then against every commit that touched a path of that basename
  (`--full-history -m -z`, because a TREESAME merge, a merge commit and a non-ASCII name each hid
  a real sworn blob from the first version), and a **document cell** decided the same way against
  `document_sha256`. Nothing here is a verdict.
- **`styxx.certify`**: every certificate issued from now on carries a `receipt_binding` block —
  `content_sha256` (CRLF→LF), the git blob the working bytes equal at HEAD, `committed`
  true/false per receipt, `all_receipts_committed`, `head`. `receipts_sha256` is untouched.
  Without git the block degrades to `head: null` with the reason and the certificate is
  otherwise byte-identical. `--require-committed` refuses to issue (exit 2, names printed) over
  uncommitted receipt bytes; the default reports, because an unmeasured gate is not shipped.
- **`styxx.corpus_audit`**: `--history auto|on|off`. With history, every record carries its
  cells, its document cell, and `stands_over_sworn_bytes` — whether the CURRENT verifier
  reproduces the recorded verdict class over the document and receipt bytes at the issuing
  commit, null with a `stands_reason` whenever those bytes cannot all be fetched — and the
  summary prints a `binding:` line beneath the uncovered line, computed before the
  missing-document return so the certificates that matter most are not skipped. **The pinned
  first line is byte-identical in every mode.** CI never runs this audit; on a depth-1 clone it
  prints `binding: history unavailable (shallow clone)`, pinned by a test on a clone the test
  builds. `--history on` exits 2 when history is unavailable.
- **The census, `receipt_binding_census.py` → `receipt_binding_census_result_2026_09_05.json`
  (the third run, from code committed at its own head; the second run,
  `receipt_binding_census_result.json`, stays as committed), over every tracked certificate
  (213, staging copies included; 631 citations), read in `RESULT_oath_receipt_binding_2026_09_05.md`,
  which swears to its leaves.** 630 citations
  `same`, every one also present at its issuing commit; 1 `at_issue`; 0 `elsewhere`, 0
  `unbacked`, 0 with an unrecoverable issuing commit. The one `at_issue` is
  `CAPSTONE_universal_mind`'s `mind_v0_validation.json` — regenerated seventeen minutes after
  its issuing commit on 2026-06-10 and reported by the audit since 2026-08-27 — whose sworn bytes
  sit at the issuing commit; the certificate **stands over the bytes it swore to**
  (`regenerated_and_standing` 1). Eight certificates' **documents** were edited after issue (cell
  `at_issue`) and all eight stand; two arXiv staging copies whose document lives unchanged under
  `papers/` read `same` with a note — the second census had read them `at_issue`, the
  edited-after-issue diff caught it, and the document cell now looks for the working file by the
  certificate's own `document` name anywhere in the tree, as the receipt cells do. `stands_over_sworn_bytes` is true for 211 and false for 2 — both
  with every byte in place, both already known (`FINDING_behavioral_sycophancy_blackbox` in
  `KNOWN_VERDICT_DRIFT`, and the read≠write submission source Charon found) — so both are the
  verifier having moved, not a binding defect; null for none. The census refuses to overwrite a
  tracked result, records the blob ids of the code that ran beside `head` (this one ran from the
  working tree that the same commit carries: `code_committed_at_head` false, head = the parent),
  and writes repository-relative paths; the first result, which carried this checkout's absolute
  paths and named the SPEC commit as its head, was removed before anything swore to it. Of six
  predictions the spec made before the run, three were confirmed, two wrong and one half-wrong
  (six recorded digests are LF hashes, so the corpus's digests are not uniformly CRLF); the
  ERRATA scores them.
- **`edited_after_issue_census.py` → `edited_after_issue_census_result.json`, read in
  `RESULT_edited_after_issue_2026_09_05.md` (sworn).** The eight documents that moved under
  their certificates, diffed against the sworn bytes: 9 lines removed, 82 added; the edits
  removed 4 ledger rows, all VERIFIED, in the two certificates of one document
  (`SYNTHESIS_connection_of_minds` and its staging copy — `0.071` and `0.057` on line 25) and
  added 26 numbers the published certificates never examined, in the same two; the live audit
  over the working document reproduces the recorded class for all eight. And the census laid
  beside Charon's log: 213 OATH lines, 207 agree; the 1 line Charon could not reproduce and the
  3 it left UNRESOLVED stand over their sworn bytes; the 2 both call failed have every byte in
  place.
- Tests: `tests/test_certify_by_digest.py` (23, plus one NTFS skip) — twenty-one on temporary
  repositories, one over the tracked corpus by the census's population rule; the existing corpus
  guard and audit tests pass unchanged.
## [Unreleased] — harness adapters v0.1: manifest minters at L1 and L2, adapters and never a recorder

**`styxx.harness` (NEW), built to `papers/sworn/DESIGN_harness_adapters_2026_09_02.md`, re-sworn and
frozen in its own commit before any code.** An adapter turns bytes a harness already holds — a test
report, a CI event payload and a diff, a tool-hook payload — into a `sworn/manifest/0.2` file that
`styxx.sworn` resolves `rN` spans against. It signs nothing, fetches nothing, verifies no signature,
observes no process and produces no verdict; the rung on every manifest is the one the caller
declared, never one the adapter detected, and L1 is printed as weak on every manifest that declares
it. `python -m styxx.harness junit|github|claude-code ...`.

- **`styxx.harness.junit`.** One report through `styxx.evidence`: r1 passed and r2 failures as ASCII
  digits (harness errors kept apart), r3 the report bytes, r4 the reader's output in RFC 8785
  canonical form so its leaves are addressable. r1 and r2 are withheld when the reader parsed no
  source — a zero from a report that did not parse is absence printed as a number. A report the
  caller says the agent wrote enters `authored_sha256`, and any span over it is MALFORMED
  `receipt_author_minted`, end to end.
- **`styxx.harness.github`.** An event payload, its base and head shas, the event name and a diff
  the caller fetched (complete only as the caller asserts, so `absent` over a truncated diff is
  MALFORMED). The fork caveat is printed into every manifest; L2 needs `--after-turn-on-base`, and on
  a fork `pull_request` (or one whose head repository is absent) also `--base-pinned-workflow`. No
  network; the environment is read only as argument defaults at the command line.
- **`styxx.harness.claude_code` and `integrations/claude-code/sworn-hooks/`.** A PostToolUse stager
  that imports nothing from `styxx` (one atomic file per event, so parallel tool calls and subagents
  under one session lose nothing) and a Stop finaliser that folds them once per turn into
  `<dir>/<session_id>.manifest.json` at L1, deterministically. Write and Edit content, the
  reconstructed post-edit text, the on-disk file and the last assistant message enter
  `authored_sha256`; Bash stdout and stderr, Read and WebFetch become receipts with honest
  completeness marks. The manifest directory must resolve outside `cwd` and `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`.
  Every entry point exits zero on every input: a hook that blocks is a gate without a measured
  precision. The README opens with the weak rung and documents the settings block for a user's own
  settings; this repository enables no hook.
- **Blind, permanently, to files written by shell commands**, and printed so on every manifest:
  `cat > f`, a heredoc, `python -c`, `git apply` never enter `authored_sha256`, and a later Read of
  such a file mints a receipt the verifier accepts.
- **The purity boundary holds in both directions** (`tests/test_harness_purity_boundary.py`):
  `styxx/sworn.py`, `styxx/evidence.py` and `styxx/__init__.py` import nothing from the package, by
  AST, by string constant and by `sys.modules` in a fresh interpreter; the JUnit and GitHub modules
  reference no ambient module below their command line; the PostToolUse script imports nothing from
  `styxx`.
- **Receipts and documents** (`papers/sworn/`): the JUnit adapter's own manifest over pytest's report
  of the adapter tests (`turn_2026_09_05_harness_adapters`, rung L1); one canned manifest per adapter
  over committed inputs, each with a short sworn document verified through the command line — the
  Claude Code one SWORN-FAILED on purpose, the agent swearing to a file it wrote.
  `RESULT_harness_adapters_ship_2026_09_05.md` is sworn against the turn manifest and says which rung
  and why.
- **What it does not say:** that any rung has been verified (R6 prints, nothing checks, L3 is
  reserved); that an L2 manifest is trustworthy beyond the declaration it rests on; that the hook
  payload shapes are stable; that a canned run is a result; that the format has been measured.
- **Owed, recorded as owed:** the adversarial pass against `styxx/harness/` before any announcement,
  with a dated ERRATA on the design; the Action that consumes the GitHub adapter (leg 3, item 4); a
  run on a runner the author cannot write to, so a manifest can honestly print L2.

## [Unreleased] — charon v0.1: the ferry log — the lab's record over three formats, re-derived from bytes, chained

**`styxx.charon` (NEW), built to `papers/charon/SPEC_charon_v01_2026_09_02.md`, committed before
the module was, with a dated ERRATA appended after the adversarial pass.** Charon is the log of
crossings: an append-only, hash-chained record in which every line is a verdict re-derived from
bytes by one of the three verifiers the lab already has — a sworn document at the commit its
sidecar names, a capsule, an OATH certificate with its receipts. Charon reproduces; it never
adjudicates, accuses no one, fetches nothing, signs nothing.
- **The receipt set is on every line, and the kind says what it means.** The 2026-09-01 dogfood
  showed an OATH verdict on fixed bytes moving FAILED → HELD as receipts were added; the line
  prints the resolved set and its digests (with the certificate's cited set beside it). 10 of 227
  held-class lines rest on ten or more receipts, max 21 — 8 OATH certificates, where a larger set
  makes HELD strictly easier, and 2 sworn documents, where the author named the leaf and volume
  buys nothing.
- **SKEW is not DRIFT.** `verify` re-derives every line and separates a core that moved with the
  instrument's bytes (SKEW) from one that moved under the same build (DRIFT), beside
  MOVED_VERIFIER, UNRESOLVED (never an accusation), HEAD_MISMATCH and TAMPER. Every corpus audit
  before this called the first two one word. `verifier.modules` carries the whole derivation
  path — Charon included — so SKEW is bounded by a stated set rather than by one file.
- **The log**: `papers/charon/charon.log.jsonl`, 243 lines — 213 certificates (every tracked one,
  the arXiv staging copies entering as UNRESOLVED lines rather than absences), 18 sworn documents,
  10 OATH capsules, 2 handoff capsules — head `bcffbebc…`; `charon_verify_result.json`: SAME_LINE
  243, TAMPER 0, which is a determinism check and not a stability result. The population is
  `papers/charon/build_log.py`, not a sentence; its one exclusion is the sworn RESULT that
  describes the log, because a snapshot cannot contain its own description.
  Seven lines record an artifact that did not reproduce at ingest or had nothing to reproduce
  against: the read≠write submission source, whose certificate re-certifies OATH-FAILED where it
  recorded OATH-HELD with every byte and receipt digest matching (the verifier moved, and the
  document sits outside the directory `REPLICATIONS.md` runs the corpus audit over); the
  universal-mind capstone, certified over a changed and therefore incomplete receipt set; the
  black-box sycophancy finding, whose verdict class moved with no receipt missing; the handoff
  capsule, whose `tests_pass` explanation string grew when the evidence channel shipped; and
  three arXiv staging certificates whose document was renamed at submission.
- **The adversarial pass, before any announcement** (`ATTACKS_charon_v01_battery_2026_09_02.md`):
  three attackers, three lenses. Four sentences the instrument published about itself were false
  and are repaired — the chain binds order to the **head** and not against rebuilding
  (`--expect-head`, HEAD_MISMATCH); capsule verdicts were **copied** from the embedded record and
  are now re-derived; `verify` compared a class and now compares the whole core (`fields_changed`,
  `subject_moved`, `receipts_moved`, and REPRODUCED renamed SAME_LINE); SKEW saw one file. Also
  repaired: a chained header, a refused headerless ingest, malformed lines as TAMPER rather than
  tracebacks, no absolute paths, a refused missing log, resolved-vs-cited receipts, `reproduced`
  via `styxx.sworn.verify_receipt`, vacuous HELD excluded, and a `derive` subcommand the page
  prints on every row. Unrepaired attacks are named in the battery with what is printed instead.
- **The page**: `papers/charon/index.html`, one static file, no script, no handler, no request —
  asserted on the bytes before they are written.
- **`styxx.capsule`**: layer 2 compares verdict **classes**, not strings. The v0.13 UNCOVERED band
  appends `, N uncovered` to a verdict — a coverage report in the headline, not a verdict change —
  and six sound capsules read as failures because of it. A class change still fails and the string
  difference is reported as advisory; `tests/test_capsule_uncovered_suffix.py` pins both.
- **`styxx.sworn`**: `GitTree._index` sizes with `--batch-check` and streams the bodies it keeps.
  Reading every blob of a tree into one buffer per commit grew a re-derivation to 13 GB and died.
- **What it does not say:** that any verdict is true; who wrote any line; that a rebuilt or
  truncated log is detectable without a head pinned outside it; that receipt shopping is
  prevented (it is printed); that anything is immutable or tamper-proof. Thirty-four `*.seal.json`
  artifacts have no deriver and appear on no line.

Also this cycle: `papers/closed-model-frontier/DESIGN_provenance_law_2026_09_02.md` (sworn) —
leg 4 of the plan, a total gates table under `styxx.protocol` with its contaminated prior cited
by digest; licenses nothing until signed.

## [Unreleased] — sworn output v0.2: attacked twelve ways, four rules paid, the coverage number withdrawn

**The adversarial pass the standing rule requires, run before any sentence about the format
left the tree.** `papers/sworn/ATTACKS_sworn_v01_battery_2026_09_02.md` (sworn) tries twelve
attacks against `styxx.sworn` as committed at `320b303`, in memory; every row is pinned by
`tests/test_sworn_attacks.py`. Four are repaired, six are not repaired and say so beside the
verdict, two survived v0.1 unchanged. Spec frozen first:
`papers/sworn/SPEC_sworn_output_v02_2026_09_02.md`; the v0.1 spec is untouched.
- **R1** `rN#/pointer` and `rN#Ln-Lm`: a numeric span names a leaf inside a harness capture.
- **R2** a tag inside an HTML comment is MALFORMED `hidden_commitment` — never HELD, never narrative.
- **R3** a `quote` needle under 16 bytes over a whole receipt is MALFORMED `short_needle`; pointer
  leaves, line anchors and `absent` are exempt (the attack is the haystack, not the needle).
- **R4** the span cap counts 300 code points, not bytes (the v0.1 disclosed inequity).
- **R5** `attestation` joins the closed source vocabulary; no signature is checked, and the
  `certifies` sentence now says so.
- **R6** manifest `sworn/manifest/0.2` declares a rung — L1 (a local hook sharing a filesystem
  with the agent, weak) or L2 (a runner after the turn); L3 reserved and refused; a 0.1 manifest
  still loads and resolves at `undeclared`, never L2.
- **R7** every span verdict carries `provenance`; every receipt carries a `rungs` count.
- **R8 — the coverage ESTIMATE is withdrawn.** Its denominator, `styxx.claimdetect` (STRUCT-1),
  is a diff-claim detector for agent pull-request prose that never reads a measured rate as a
  claim. `papers/sworn/coverage_census_v01.py` (read through git plumbing at `320b303`) shows it
  printed 0.6667–1.0 beside all twelve committed sworn documents while counting 20 of 932
  narrative sentences; the grain synthesis printed 0.9412 with one fragment counted against 98
  sentences. `sworn/coverage/1` prints `narrative_sentences`, `sentence_share` (a floor that
  treats every narrative sentence as load-bearing and so cannot flatter — 0.0156–0.2185 across
  the same twelve) and STRUCT-1's count labelled with its idiom. Neither is bound recall.
- **R9** verdict receipt `styxx.sworn.verdict-receipt/v1`: the digest covers the core without
  coverage; coverage travels beside it under `coverage_sha256`; `verify_receipt` is schema-aware
  and a `/v0` receipt still checks on its core. All twelve committed receipts re-issued under v1
  by `reissue_receipts_v1.py`, which refuses if any span verdict moves; none did.
- Every JSON the CLI writes is LF on every platform (`_write_json_lf`); a Windows text-mode write
  would have CRLF'd a byte-pinned sidecar. `manifest new` requires `--rung`; `manifest add`
  takes `--note`.
- Dogfood: `RESULT_sworn_v02_ships_2026_09_02.md` (sworn to the harness manifest at rung L1 and
  to the verifier's own blob hash) and `EXPLORATORY_handedness_by_kind_2026_09_02.md` (sworn to
  `handedness_v3_by_kind_result.json`: the token-kind split of the v3 rows that a same-day
  objection cited as "kind-adjusted 0.117" with no receipt — the receipt says 0.1695, integer
  stratum odds ratio 3.11, one repository supplying 184 of 334 rows; exploratory, never a result).
- **Owed, unchanged and restated:** the measurement (`DESIGN_sworn_measurement_v2_2026_09_02.md`,
  waiting on the operator's signature); conformance vectors before any second verifier; the
  prior-art survey before any "we know of no other"; L1/L2 harness adapters; a release —
  `styxx.sworn` is not in 7.47.0 and a stranger cannot `pip install` it.

## [Unreleased] — sworn output v0.1: the author declares, the receipt disposes

**Sworn output (`styxx.sworn`, NEW).** Spec frozen first —
`papers/sworn/SPEC_sworn_output_v01_2026_09_01.md` — then built. Format `sworn/0.1`, manifest
`sworn/manifest/0.1`, verdict receipt `styxx.sworn.verdict-receipt/v0`. Every instrument this
lab built to *find* claims in prose was measured against strangers and did not survive it
(0.23 in the wild, 0.16 held-out after repair, 0.4211 at the best structural attempt). Sworn
does not find claims. The author binds one sentence at write time to bytes it could not have
written — `<sworn r="RECEIPT" k="KIND">…</sworn>` — and everything unbound is narrative by
definition, never accused. The verifier is handed commitments, not a target.
- **Lexer:** tags recognised only outside fenced regions and inline backtick spans, by one exact
  byte pattern; anything tag-shaped that is not the pattern is MALFORMED and never narrative
  (silent downgrade is how a format gets gamed). Unbalanced fences and undecodable UTF-8 are
  document-level MALFORMED, never UNSWORN.
- **Canonical form:** tags deleted, UTF-8 byte offsets recorded, tags re-inserted, bytes compared
  — a sidecar that cannot round-trip is REFUSED, never written. Newlines are never normalised.
- **Receipts:** `rN` from a harness-minted manifest; `path:` at the commit the document names,
  through git plumbing and never a working tree; `prereg:SHA256` by content address. UNRESOLVED
  is the verifier saying it could not see, and is never an accusation.
- **Kinds:** `numeric` (the span is cut into maximal tokens and exactly one may carry a digit, so
  a fragment of a number can never be extracted — the OATH `_NUM` defect, refused by
  construction; Decimal on the printed digits, ROUND_HALF_EVEN, no float, no percent
  conversion, no search over leaves), `quote`, `hash`, `absent` (negatives only over complete
  objects). `exec` is v0.2 and MALFORMED here.
- **Verdicts:** HELD / FAILED / UNRESOLVED / MALFORMED / WITHHELD (reserved, no producer);
  SWORN-HELD / SWORN-FAILED / UNSWORN — a document that swore nothing is never "no failures".
  Every non-HELD verdict carries a reason from a closed enum.
- **The four invariants, mechanically:** no function proposes tags; a receipt with an author-side
  `kind_of_source` or a digest in the manifest's `authored_sha256` is MALFORMED; UNSWORN is a
  distinct verdict; coverage (advisory, counted by `styxx.claimdetect` at its documented
  0.4211 ceiling, n=38) prints beside every verdict and can never touch one.
- **Receipt:** content-addressed via `styxx.attestation.jcs`, re-derivable in the parrhesia manner,
  carrying a `certifies` boundary and every implementation decision the spec left open
  (`DECISIONS`, pinned by tests). `sworn` is not on the package surface and does not shadow
  `styxx.parrhesia`.
- **Dogfood:** `DECLARATION_h_mapping_2026_09_01.md` is the first sworn document in the tree
  (25 counts bound to its census receipt at a commit; SWORN-HELD) and
  `papers/sworn/RESULT_sworn_v01_ships_2026_09_01.md` the second — bound to the manifest
  `papers/sworn/harness_pytest.py` minted from the test run, to the verifier's own bytes by hash,
  and to the frozen spec by content address (SWORN-HELD, 13 held, 0 unresolved).
  `tests/test_sworn_dogfood.py` re-derives every committed sworn document.
- **Hardened by an adversarial pass** (three independent attackers, lexer / receipts / gaming):
  a sidecar the loader refuses is never emitted, every bad shape is refused rather than crashed
  on, git pathspec magic and globs never reach the tree, a tampered receipt FAILS rather than
  crashing or refusing, and the commit the document names is authoritative over the tree handle.
- **Owed, unchanged:** no measurement of sworn output exists; nothing here is evidence that
  authors bind the sentences that matter. The `rN` form carries no pointer, so a numeric span
  against an `rN` needs a one-number capture — a v0.2 usability item. Tags inside HTML comments
  are recognised (the spec's lexical rules are closed); a hidden commitment inflating coverage
  is a v0.2 item.

**The frequency arc: the efficiency control the arc owed itself, and the profiler shipped.**
`RESULT_efficiency_control_from_receipts_2026_09_02.md` reads two committed receipts of one
experiment together: at every width measured, a static bank with fewer parameters than the
adaptive-frequency model beats it (0.460 vs 0.375 at D=4 against a D=8 static bank; 0.678 vs 0.545
at D=8 against a D=16 static bank, which beats the D=8 oracle too). The adaptive line's last positive
was capacity in disguise. Not preregistered, said so, every number sworn; the frozen rule is
`PREREG_efficiency_control_2026_09_02.md`, run on CPU the same day: **CAPACITY_IN_DISGUISE** under
the frozen gates (`RESULT_efficiency_control_2026_09_02.md`, sworn) — the matched static bank at D=26 beats
RICH at D=8 by 0.196 and beats the D=8 oracle; at D=4 the matched bank beats RICH by 0.305.
`styxx/resonance.py` (NEW) is the resonance profiler the audit listed as built and never shipped,
framework-agnostic and tested without torch: it decomposes a trained model's score into decay floor,
static-oscillation reliance and adaptation reliance, and says in its own output that it diagnoses a
model and never licenses a primitive.

**Token-level h on the blind panel: INVALID, shipped as INVALID, and a v2 frozen against the real
documents.** `PREREG_handedness_accusations_2026_09_02.md` joined the 366 panel-judged external
accusations to the obligation source re-derived from the harness ledger; its own plumbing gate
tripped (half the accusations reach no clause from the ledger — the verifier obligates table cells
through their header, the ledger recorded the row) and the RESULT ships as
`INVALID__rederivation_diverged`, with the object_form cell found empty on this corpus.
`oath_external_recertify.py` rebuilds the pinned corpus from raw GitHub, hash-verified, cached
outside the tree, and re-certifies it with the current verifier so every token carries the
verifier's own source; `PREREG_handedness_v2_header_bound_2026_09_02.md` freezes the hypothesis this
corpus can hold — header-handed against line-handed accusations — with its contaminated prior declared.

**Token-level h, v3, preregistered and HELD: HEADER_HANDED_ACCUSES_TRUER.** On the 366 panel-judged
external accusations, rebuilt from pinned shas and re-certified: accusations the verifier was handed
by a table header are genuine at 0.9515 (n=165); those handed by a trigger word in the line are
genuine at 0.6391 (n=169); range-sanity accusations 0 for 13. The false accusations on foreign text
are, to first order, the line-handed ones — mention-versus-use inside handed-target. The h
declaration carries a sworn addendum; two INVALID runs before it are shipped as INVALID.

**SYNTHESIS — the grain of the handed target; h-mapping v2.** `papers/SYNTHESIS_the_grain_of_the_handed_target_2026_09_02.md`
(sworn, 16 spans, every number bound to the receipt that holds it) reads the day's five preregistered
verdicts together: a target handed by structure the author committed to (a header, an `n=` register,
an oath tag, a trained rotation) held against strangers; a target handed by co-occurrence (a line word,
a rule outside its idiom, a self-built detector) was the false accusation, the capacity in disguise,
the detector that never earned its parameters. M2 in the audit acquires a grain — an addendum, the
frozen table untouched. `h_mapping.json` moves to schema v2: `grain` per `object_text` source
(vocabulary is `mixed`, split per token by `binding_context.header_bound`; `n=` structural; the
correlation and range-sanity clauses incidental) and `target_grain` per instrument row (sworn is the
limiting case, all structure). Census re-folded under the new mapping hash; two tests pin the column.

**OATH v0.14, preregistered and SHIP: range-sanity reports instead of accusing.** `V14_RANGE_SANITY_REPORT`
(default OFF, nothing committed changes) turns the v0.3 out-of-range rule into a reporter. The A/B: on
the lab's own 207 documents the flag moves 0 of 8,583 tokens; on the rebuilt external corpus it removes
exactly the 13 accusations the panel called non-claims, taking the external false-accusation rate from
0.2596 to 0.2323. The RESULT recommends the flip; the flip is the release cycle's.

**The confound in the phase clamp, preregistered.** `PREREG_untied_magnitudes_2026_09_02.md`: the
clamp removes rotation and, in the same move, ties each complex mode's two real channels to one
magnitude. REAL2 — a real bank with 2D independent magnitudes, exactly FREE's state and parameters —
separates rotation from timescale diversity on the rhythm-rescue task. Run on CPU the same day:
**ROTATION_LOAD_BEARING__beyond_diversity** (`RESULT_untied_magnitudes_2026_09_02.md`, sworn) — anchors
reproduce the GPU receipt to the digit, and the untied real bank lands exactly on CLAMPED (recovery 0.0).
The arc's headline survives its own confound; the permuted-MNIST re-run is the owed next preregistration.

**The eleven-instrument census, with receipts.** `papers/sworn/CENSUS_prose_claimhood_instruments_2026_09_01.md`
(sworn) and `prose_claimhood_census.json` (built by `prose_claimhood_census.py`, which resolves
every pointer): the audit's eleven prose-reading instruments, each with the document that measured
it, its headline number, and the JSON receipt and pointer when one exists — so "eleven" is now a
count of a receipt rather than a phrase, and the rows that rest on prose alone are named as such.

**The measurement, designed and not faked.** `papers/sworn/DESIGN_sworn_measurement_2026_09_01.md`:
bound recall, trivial swearing, coverage error and the gaming price (spec items 3 and 4), with the
panel reading the canonical text so it cannot be handed the author's target, five gates proposed
with reasons, and the builder's own documents excluded as specimens chosen to pass. Deliberately a
DESIGN, to be frozen as a PREREG by signature — a lock hash of "TBD" is the shape the audit named
as the worst of both.

**Back-pointers.** Fourteen documents the audit's staleness table lists as killed by a document
that names them now carry one blockquote line under the title naming the killer and the date;
text unchanged, no numbers added, certified documents keep their verdicts. README's "switched off"
now says the branch was later deleted.

**corpus_audit.** Since the UNCOVERED band a verdict reads `OATH-HELD, N uncovered`; the auditor
compared whole strings, put 131 of 208 certificates in neither HELD nor FAILED and read every one
as verdict drift. `verdict_class()` buckets and drift-detects on the class; the corpus uncovered
totals are folded and printed on their own line beside the verdict line, never inside it.

**h — the handedness mapping declared.** `DECLARATION_h_mapping_2026_09_01.md` +
`h_mapping.json` + `h_mapping_census.py`: every `obligation_source` the verifier can emit (five)
plus the defined-but-unshipped `structural-precision` mapped to who handed the verifier its target
(`object_text` / `object_form`; nothing is receipt- or externally-handed). Two populations that
must never be pooled — PRINTED (18 of 208 committed certificates carry per-token epistemics) and
LIVE (207 documents re-certified) — and two denominators named: `vocabulary` is 0.83 of obligated
and 0.35 of verified on the same run. A test fails if a new source appears without a mapping.

**AUDIT addendum M7 — verifier-version stratification.** Every field the certificate gains
silently partitions the corpus by verifier build; found four times on 2026-09-01 and added to the
program audit as a dated addendum.

## [7.47.0] — the boundary arc: epistemics per token, the agent gate priced, structure over word lists, and the first external bug report

The week the instrument stack started overruling its builders on the record.

**OATH / certify**
- `epistemics_summary` v1 on every certificate: per-token `{branch, obligated,
  obligation_source, path_checked}` folded into a machine-readable boundary block —
  what the verifier was obligated to check, what it volunteered, what it never read.
- **`V11_FRACTION_COHERENCE = True`** — integer operands of an explicit `A/B` whose
  same-line ratio checks out arithmetically bind jointly under one common receipt
  parent. Strictly rescue-only; shipped through four gates including an absolute
  corpus A/B (three tokens moved, all licensed, zero wrong). Repairs the verifier
  taxing the counts statements its own preregs mandate.
- CLI prints the obligation split ("of N verified: X obligated, Y volunteered") and
  corpus_audit folds a corpus-wide epistemics line.

**diffgate / agent attestation**
- The never-read band is first-class: `sentences_total`, `uncovered_texts`, and
  `unparsed_claims` (via the new STRUCT-1 observer) on every gate result, confessed
  on every CLI run.
- `styxx.claimdetect` (STRUCT-1): a structural claim detector for agent prose that
  beat its verb-list null 0.4211 to 0.2061 on a fresh blind panel, with a zero-claim
  control arm. Observer-only by tested invariant.

**MCP / cognometrics**
- **The not-stacc fix**: absence of logprobs (every Anthropic response) now returns
  `classification "unmeasured", gate "unmeasured", measured: false` with the reason
  named — it used to classify missing data as `adversarial`/`fail`. Found in
  production by the project's longest-running MCP user; regression-pinned by
  `tests/test_unmeasured_not_adversarial.py`.

**OATH Capsule — the proof-carrying document (`styxx.capsule`, NEW)**
- **v0.1**: one self-contained HTML file carrying a paper's exact bytes, every
  receipt's exact bytes, the certificate verbatim, and two verification layers the
  READER runs — browser WebCrypto tamper-evidence (offline, zero requests, every
  token painted with its epistemic band) and `python -m styxx.capsule verify`
  re-running the real verifier. Creation refuses to lie; capsules of FAILED papers
  are first-class and shipped.
- **v0.2 — the agent-handoff capsule**: seals (agent summary, unified diff, diffgate
  record) with the gate a pure function of the two byte streams (strict=False,
  run=None, environment legs refused at mint). Layer 2 re-derives the full record at
  the installed instrument; `unparsed_claims` is advisory by construction; instrument
  skew is distinguished from tamper. Sealed-record forgeries that re-seal their own
  binding hash are caught by re-execution (the K2 test). Specs frozen first:
  `SPEC_oath_capsule_v01_2026_08_31.md`, `SPEC_oath_capsule_v02_2026_08_31.md`.
- The first v0.2 capsule minted is the v0.2 implementation itself, gated against its
  own diff: `HANDOFF_capsule_v02_2026_08_31.capsule.html`.

**OATH / certify — V12 MIRROR-SUM** (`PREREG_mirror_sum_2026_08_31`)
- **`V12_SUM_COHERENCE = True`** — an integer the ladder would otherwise accuse binds
  iff it equals the exhaustive same-field sum over ALL dict-children of one receipt
  node (≥2 integer addends, not all equal). Repairs the pooled denominator: the
  OBLIGATE-1 `115` (= arms.positive.valid + arms.negative.valid) comes home on all
  three occurrences. The non-uniform rule was forced by pre-freeze grounding: a
  quoted "9" coincides with nine seat scores of 1 each, and a uniform sum is
  indistinguishable from counting — refused. Absolute corpus A/B: 3 tokens moved,
  all the prereg-named specimens, zero wrong, zero verdict flips. OBLIGATE-1
  re-certifies still FAILED (32/22/3) — a class repaired, not a verdict.

**Research record shipped alongside**: the agent-gate boundary RESULT, the blind-panel
baseline that overturned its author, OBLIGATE-1's held-out negative, OBLIGATE-2's
split verdict, and two papers published OATH-FAILED by the verifier they describe.
Corpus at release: 202 certificates, HELD 195, FAILED 7 — failures included.

## [Unreleased] — OATH v0.10: the context windows were pointed at the wrong token

Closes the defect the v0.9 entry below disclosed and did not repair. `certify_doc`
located each extracted token with `ctx.find(num["token"])` — the FIRST occurrence
of the token *string* on the line, not the occurrence `extract_numbers` extracted.
Across the 48097 tokens in the 1073 markdown documents under `papers/`, **4612
(9.589%, in 841 documents) were anchored on a different token**, so `pre` and
`post` described some other token's neighbourhood and every predicate downstream
of them — `is_spec`, `is_notation`, `is_hist`, the range-sanity `unit_kw`/`sign_kw`
tests, the slash-pair branch of count-binding, the v0.5 class F `n=` self-scope and
the class E derived-percent parse — was decided against text that does not surround
the claim. In the certified corpus, 95 of 349 misplaced tokens have a predicate
that actually disagrees between the two anchors.

**`V10_TOKEN_COLUMN = True`.** `extract_numbers` records `col`, the column its
match was found at, and `certify_doc` anchors its windows there. The clause indicts
one shipped three commits earlier: `PREREG_b49_amplitude_reaudit` line 23 holds a
preregistered bar in JSON value position at column 98, `ctx.find` returns 6 — the
digit inside the identifier `b45` — and `V09_IS_SPEC_JSON_IDIOM`, shipped for
exactly that class, never fires on a member of it. A clause can pass every gate
written for it and still be withheld from the tokens it was built for.

**The precondition nobody had checked.** `re.sub(pat, " ", line)` collapses each
sha/date/version match to ONE space, so a raw `m.start()` would have been a *new*
wrong column on every line carrying one. The scrub is now length-preserving, and
that is gated: across all 1075 documents the two arms extract an identical ordered
token list, **0** differing.

**`V10_SLASHPAIR_RANGE_GUARD = True`.** The repair un-masks exactly one latent
false accusation — a slash-pair count sitting after bounded-quantity vocabulary,
which range-sanity reads as an out-of-range measurement and accuses. The guard says
range-sanity does not fire on a slash-pair numerator. With the primary off it
changes 0 ledger rows and 0 tamper outcomes: it carries no behaviour of its own.

**The cost, published rather than buried.** 27 tokens move ABSTAIN→VERIFIED (23
adjudicate correct, 0 wrong) and 17 move VERIFIED→ABSTAIN (9 destroy a genuine
binding). The largest restored class is the *observed* column of a markdown gate
table — a row printing its bar and its result as the same digits had every token
anchored at the bar, so the measurement was abstained as if it were its own
threshold, on the one column such a table exists to report. All 9 destroyed
bindings are one defect: `is_spec` reads a bare `=` at the end of `pre` as a
comparison operator, which with correct windows fires on the *assignment* idiom
(`n = 1`, `n_refits=5`, `0.0854 = 0.0854`). Named `V10_EQUALS_SPEC_OVERREACH` and
deliberately not fixed — `V07_PRECISION_DIGITS = 7` is a spec and
`AUROC(S_frame) = 0.75` is not, and the two are identical in form.

**Tamper: declared no-credit in advance, and one column goes the wrong way.** On
the channel where the *mutation* creates the collision (434 mutants over ten
seeds), catches rise 34→43 but false attestations rise 233→271 as 47 abstentions
become verdicts. An abstention produced by a misplaced window is not a safety
property — it is arbitrary, and the same doctored number on a line with different
earlier text would not have abstained. The false attestations that surface are the
v0.4 debt, closed NEGATIVE by v0.8; making a known rate visible is not creating it.
A cycle that declined to fix its addressing to protect a flattering tamper column
would be committing v0.9's error one register over.

**Also found: the v0.9 harness's baseline key.** `<doc>|L<line>|<token>` collides
when a line carries the same token twice, merging 199 rows across 177 colliding
pairs — precisely this cycle's population. v0.10's baseline appends the ledger
ordinal. Of the merged rows, 0 hide a differing status, so v0.9's G5 verdict stands.

Battery (`run_oath_v10_battery.py`, both arms, all bars frozen before the edit):
G0 sweep fidelity reproduced exactly, G1 anchoring 0 ON vs 349 OFF, G2 extraction
invariance 0, G3 0 new accusations and 0 verdict flips, G4a 23/27 correct + 0
wrong, G4b 9/17, G4c 9/9 explained, G5 0 and 0, G6a/G6b no regression. Corpus
verdicts unmoved: 138 OATH-HELD, 1 OATH-FAILED, before and after. Ledger entries
gain one integer (`col`); committed certificates are untouched.

## [Unreleased] — OATH v0.9: a bar in JSON idiom abstains, and the prose bar clause is refused

`is_spec` (the v0.1 SPEC-CONSTANT rule) abstains a pre-registered bar, because a
bar's receipt is the preregistration and not a result JSON. It recognised a bar
only from an operator character or bar vocabulary in an eighteen-character window
immediately before the token, so a bar written as
`{"metric": "…", "op": ">=", "value": 0.75}` — operator in a sibling field the
window cannot see — was never rescued. v0.7 named this class and left it open.

**`V09_IS_SPEC_JSON_IDIOM = True`.** A token in JSON value position whose object
also carries a comparison-operator field is a SPECIFICATION. 145 such tokens live
in 42 documents under `papers/`; the shipped verifier rescued 0 of them. The class
is live: `PREDICTION_h1_human_islands`'s committed certificate swears two
*different* preregistered bars — a dip-test *p*-value and an R² — against the one
unrelated leaf `b45_result.json:null_expectation_k20`, whose sole qualification is
holding the float `0.05`. The operator field is required, not optional: `"value":
0.75` alone is an ordinary key/value pair, and it is the operator that makes the
number a bound *on* a quantity rather than a record *of* one.

**`V09_IS_SPEC_BAR_NOUN = False`.** The same doctrine in prose form — "clears the
0.10 floor" — was measured and **refused**, and is retained at `False` with its
measurement so one flag reproduces the negative. 38 such tokens sit in the
certified corpus, 37 VERIFIED, and **36 of them are on lines the verifier already
obligates**. Only an obligated token can be accused when it is doctored, so only an
obligated token has a catch that an abstention rule can destroy. Mutating all 38
across ten seeds, the shipped verifier catches 18.7 on average (range 16–22). The
clause takes that column to **zero at every seed**, because the predicate reads
context and a one-digit substitution leaves the context unchanged. It does not
detect the tamper it would be credited with; it stops looking.

**The trap, named.** In the same arm, false attestations fall from a range of
14–20 to at most 1. A cycle measuring only that column would have reported a
twenty-point improvement and shipped. The improvement is real and it is bought
entirely with silence — so the gate that refuses it (G6) was preregistered as
expected-to-fail and kept, because it is also the positive control that makes the
shipping clause's zeros readable. A screen with unknown recall reporting zero on a
corpus is indistinguishable from a screen that cannot see.

**Residual, published with the change.** The shipping clause has **no measurable
effect on any certificate today**: of the 145 tokens, 4 sit in a document carrying
a certificate and **0** sit in one whose receipts all resolve, so the corpus delta
is zero by construction and the value is forward-looking. Left unclosed: the 38
prose bar tokens, and the receipt-side variant (63 VERIFIED tokens grounding in a
`frozen_gates`-like leaf) rejected unbuilt because it consults the match set and
so stops firing under exactly the mutation it exists to handle. Neither is a
coverage hole; both are false-attestation surface, which only status-level
claim→field binding for floats can attack.

Battery: G1 recall 145 ON vs 1 OFF (bar ≥140/≤2), G2 25/25 hand-adjudicated BAR,
G3 0 VERIFIED→ABSTAIN, G4 0 accusations silenced and 0 verdict flips, G5 0 ledger
differences with the flags off, G6 FAIL as preregistered. One disclosed defect
found and not repaired here: `certify_doc` locates a token with `ctx.find`, which
returns the first occurrence of the token *string* rather than the extracted span,
which costs G1 its last point and lets at most one mutant per seed escape.

**Convergent with 7.46.0, and not by arrangement.** `V08_FLOAT_FIELD_BINDING` closed NEGATIVE under
`V08_COVERAGE_DESTRUCTIVE` from a concurrent cycle sharing no code with this one, attacking the same
false-attestation channel from the receipt side. Two instruments, two independently frozen
preregistrations, one verdict: what the demotion removed from the VERIFIED column it did not move
into the caught column. The v0.4 debt is not a missing demotion rule — demotion is the wrong shape
of answer, and neither cycle found the right one.

No version bump: `styxx/_version.py`, tags and releases are untouched.

## [7.46.0] — 2026-08-23 — the v0.4 float-binding debt, built and closed NEGATIVE

`styxx/certify.py` has carried a note at the v0.3 count-binding site since July:
*"Floats keep value-only matching (v0.4 owes them full claim→field binding)."* An
INTEGER claim's value-matches are filtered to leaves whose receipt PATH shares a
word stem with the claim's line; floats were exempt. v0.6.2 applied the same test
to floats but attribution-only — it could reorder matches, never change a status.

This release builds the promotion, measures it, and does **not** ship it.

**The target.** Of the claims the verifier certifies VERIFIED, mutating one
significant digit leaves 604 still VERIFIED — matched to an unrelated receipt
leaf. That is affirmative false attestation, and no obligation rule can reach it:
obligation decides whether a claim *must* match, and these already do. Only field
binding can. The reachable ceiling was stated before the work began: 330, not 604,
because the other 274 are integers that pass through the shipped count-binding
filter and false-verify anyway.

**What it scored.** Demote-only (VERIFIED → ABSTAIN, never UNGROUNDED), floats at
1–3 decimals, binding window widened one line, and demoting only where the
receipts carry a path the sentence names. It cleared every mechanical bar: 107
false attestations removed at a fresh gating seed against a bar of 60, cost ratio
1.056 against 1.5, severability exact at 0 ledger differences, and its demote-only
invariant held exactly — UNGROUNDED and OATH-HELD counts unchanged, every
transition VERIFIED → ABSTAIN.

**Why it still does not ship.** Forty demotions were hand-scored against a frozen
definition with ties resolved against the clause. **30 of 40 destroyed a GENUINE
binding** — the leaf really was the claim's home — against a bar of 12. Kill token
`V08_COVERAGE_DESTRUCTIVE`. The prereg predicted two thirds to three quarters
before the adjudication ran, so this is a pre-registered negative.

The structural reason is the finding: prose names a measurement narratively
("whole-stack r=16: 0.616–0.626") while the field that holds it is structural
(`points[2].naive_relock_auroc`). Path-stem overlap has no purchase on that, and
the tampered claim sits in the same sentence as the honest one and inherits its
vocabulary. Five design families were swept before the edit and none beats parity
— the instrument buys about one honest demotion per false attestation removed, at
best. An accusing variant was rejected outright: every operating point of every
family would have put dozens of new UNGROUNDED tokens on honest documents.

**The residual this release publishes.** The clause moves the silent-pass residual
by nothing at all. In both arms the number of mutants the verifier fails to accuse
is identical — 2608 at the gating seed. What the clause changes is the
*composition*: false attestation becomes named abstention. Reporting the 107
without that sentence would launder the coverage. The residual stands where 7.45.0
left it, and the false-attestation channel remains open.

`V08_FLOAT_FIELD_BINDING = False`, kept in tree behind its flag with the
measurement in the source comment (as `V05_APPROX_NOTATION` was after its
severability drop) so the negative is re-runnable and not re-attempted. Nine
regression tests lock the default OFF and assert the invariant. The v0.4 debt is
**CLOSED_NEGATIVE** and is no longer carried as owed work.

Prereg `PREREG_oath_v08_float_field_binding_2026_08_23.md`, RESULT
`RESULT_oath_v08_float_field_binding_CLOSED_NEGATIVE_2026_08_23.md` (OATH-HELD).

Next leads, in order: `is_spec` JSON-idiom recall (bars written as `{"op": "<=",
"value": ...}` never fire the spec rule and value-match their own `frozen_gates.*`
leaf — 9 of the 40 adjudicated demotions were this class), then the 274 integer
false-attestations that count-binding does not stop.

### Also in this release — the silent-pass benchmark was losing a third of its corpus

`benchmarks/silent_pass.Case.pre_fix_source` shells out to `git show` with
`text=True` and no explicit encoding, so Python decodes with the platform locale —
cp1252 on Windows. One source byte invalid there raises `UnicodeDecodeError` inside
subprocess's reader *thread*, stdout returns empty, and the case silently leaves the
benchmark labelled "unavailable". Measured: **13 of 20 cases loadable, 7 lost**;
after pinning UTF-8, **20 of 20**. Corrected recall over the full corpus: absence
0.45, loops 0.25, union 0.65.

The corpus exists to document absent measurements surfaced as results, and
`test_an_unloadable_case_is_unscored_never_a_miss` states that property outright —
while its own loader was manufacturing unloadable cases from an encoding crash. It
also explains a red test on trunk: the complementarity test asserts SP-7 caught ≥ 2,
the corpus holds exactly 2 SP-7 cases, and only 1 was loadable, so the bar was
unreachable and read as a detector failure. No bar was touched; the corpus was
restored. Pinned by a test that names the unloadable cases, so the loader is checked
before the detector is blamed.

### And the same defect class in the shipped package

Sweeping for it found the identical bug in `styxx.agent_audit._run`, which reads git
**diffs** — arbitrary source bytes. `git_show_diff_contains` computes `substring in
diff`, so a locale-decoded diff makes it answer **MATCH=False for a substring that is
genuinely present**: an auditor calling a truthful claim unsupported. Demonstrated on
one commit — a needle containing U+2212 reads `True` pinned and `False` locale-decoded.
Correct on Linux, wrong on Windows, and quiet on both.

`styxx.protocol._committed_at` fails safe by comparison (it refuses to score rather
than passing) but reported the misleading reason "prereg is not committed" when the
real cause was a decode. `styxx.diffgate`'s test runner only reads `returncode`. All
three are pinned to `encoding="utf-8", errors="replace"`; `styxx/` now has zero
unpinned text-mode subprocess calls.

Guarded by an AST test that fails on any future unpinned call anywhere in the shipped
package — the class, not the three sites that happened to be found — plus a functional
test that reintroducing the bug turns red with "U+2212 is in the diff but was reported
missing".

---

## [Unreleased] — lint was red, so the test suite had not run in CI for weeks

The `tests` workflow gates the test step behind `ruff check styxx`. Lint had been
failing on five errors since the contract/flattering work landed, so every push
since — including the 7.45.0 release — reported a red suite that **never
executed**. This is the second time lint has masked the tests in this repo.

Four of the five were cosmetic. The fifth was a dead guard: `diffgate.py` read
`except (IndexError, error)`, and `error` is an undefined name, so when
`m.start("path")` did raise, Python evaluated the except clause, hit `NameError`,
and propagated it instead of returning `False`. Reproduced before fixing, and
pinned by a test that fails with `NameError` at that line when the bug is put
back. It sat in the module whose entire job is refusing to accuse someone who
told the truth — a leg that cannot fail, which is the same defect shape 7.45.0
was published to describe.

With lint clear, the full suite passes on CI across py3.9–py3.12.

---

## [7.45.0] — 2026-08-22 — the OATH's published debt was measured against the wrong denominator

`styxx.certify` obligated a number only when its line carried recognised trigger
vocabulary. Issue #39 published the size of that gap as **0.5227 of full-precision
decimals sit on unbound lines** and asked for broader obligation. Broader
obligation shipped here. The more useful result is that the debt line describes a
pool, not the hole.

**The reframe.** 177 of the 183 unbound full-precision tokens in the corpus are
*already* VERIFIED on clean documents, because VERIFIED is awarded on a value-match
to a receipt leaf whether or not the number was obligated. Unbound does not mean
unchecked. The hole opens under tamper: change the number, the value-match
disappears, the obligation never fires because it never depended on the value, and
the mutant lands in ABSTAIN while the document keeps its OATH-HELD verdict.

**It had already cost a repair.** `oath_v062_repair_addendum.json` was built at
v0.6.2 to persist a bare-arm accuracy that existed only inside a gate detail
string. The same token appears in two documents; only the one whose line carried
trigger vocabulary was flagged and fixed. The other went on citing a number its
receipts did not hold. The gap steered a repair loop away from a real provenance
gap.

### Added
- **OATH v0.7 precision obligation** (`V07_PRECISION_OBLIGATION`,
  `V07_PRECISION_DIGITS = 7`). A token printed at seven or more fractional digits
  was copied out of a computation, so it is obligated regardless of line
  vocabulary. The predicate reads only the token, which is the whole point: an
  obligation that consults the match set evaporates under exactly the mutation it
  is supposed to catch. The candidate rule "receipt-path stem overlap AND
  value-match" scored a perfect zero clean-corpus accusations and catches nothing;
  it was rejected for that reason.
  Threshold 7 rather than 5 because every live counterexample the red-team pass
  produced sits at five or six digits — a frozen kill-gate bar written in this
  repo's own JSON idiom, the half-ULP tolerance definition, π written out, a
  Bonferroni α, the arXiv DOI prefix `10.48550` that neither `_VERSIONISH` nor
  v0.5 class C reaches. Cycle 24 died on one token on a guard boundary.
- **ULP-neighbour escape** (`V07_ULP_ESCAPE`, `V07_ULP_N = 8`), severable. v0.6.2
  withdrew the epsilon subsidy at ≥13 decimals, so at 16 the tolerance sits below
  the float64 ULP. Safe while such tokens were never obligated; the clause above
  makes it live, and without the escape a restatement of the same measurement by
  differently ordered arithmetic reads as a false claim. Yields ABSTAIN with a
  countable `ulp-neighbour` reason, never VERIFIED, so the v0.6.2 hole stays shut
  and the residual is enumerable rather than invisible.
- **`run_oath_v07_battery.py`** with the OFF arm as a **positive control**. The
  prereg pre-committed to voiding the run if the ON arm did not exceed it. Catch
  on previously-unbound lines: **0/20 off, 20/20 on.**
- **`oath_v07_census.py`** and **`oath_v07_silentpass_census.py`** — both censuses,
  committed and re-runnable.

### Fixed
- `FINDING_third_party_bench_2026_07_24` cited a bare-arm accuracy its receipt set
  held only inside a string. Repaired by receipt-set extension with the existing
  addendum, under its own commit. Checked against the cycle-26 kill: certifying
  with and without the addendum moves exactly one status.

### The residual — published because the release would otherwise launder itself
Mutate one significant digit of every claim the shipped verifier certifies
VERIFIED and re-certify: of **3951** claims, **2696 are not accused — 0.6824**.
Of those, 2005 abstain, 87 stop extracting, and **604 come back VERIFIED against
some unrelated leaf**, an affirmative false attestation that no precision
threshold touches. **135 of 136** documents contain at least one silently mutable
claim. By decimal width the unaccused are 736 bare integers, then 289 / 257 / 423
/ 814 at one to four decimals. **v0.7 reaches 176 of the 2696.**

The trigger-recall gap is not closed. It was measured against the wrong
denominator, the real one is now on record with a re-runnable script, and this
release closes a small, well-understood corner of it. Still owed, in order:
status-level claim→field binding for floats (which is what would attack the 604),
`is_spec` recall on JSON-idiom bars (157 tokens rescued zero times), and
fence/code-span awareness in `extract_numbers`, whose docstring already claims a
behaviour it does not have.

---

## [7.44.2] — 2026-08-21 — the product page made a claim nobody could re-run

`action.yml` told every prospective user the gate was *"validated on real
agent-authored PRs with zero false accusations."* The receipts were real — 80
commits at 7.29.1, 24 agent PRs at 7.29.2, both of which found and fixed
false-accusation classes before claiming zero. But that was **fifteen releases
ago**, the sweeps were run ad hoc, **no harness was ever committed**, and the
sentence was written in the present tense. An unreproducible receipt is a claim,
not evidence.

### Added
- **`scripts/diffgate_validation_sweep.py`** — the sweep, committed, re-runnable
  by anyone: this repo's own commits (message vs its own diff) and real public
  PRs whose body carries the Claude Code marker (body vs the diff GitHub serves).
  It refuses to call a contradiction a caught lie on its own: every CONTRADICTED
  is printed with its evidence for adjudication, and it prints **coverage**
  alongside the headline, because zero contradictions is also what a gate that
  extracts nothing produces.

### Fixed — three false-accusation classes, found by re-running it on 7.44.1
- **A path NAMED is not a path CLAIMED, comparative form.** *"Fixed the same way
  `sla.py` was"* — an analogy to an earlier change — was accused of not touching
  `sla.py`.
- **Explicit non-inclusion.** *"(fetch-depth: 0 in `test.yml`) is staged"* — a
  sentence that says **in words** the file is not in this diff — was accused
  anyway. A gate that cannot read "staged" does not get to call a summary a liar.
  Both windows around the path are now inspected; the first attempt at this fix
  only looked backwards and still accused the second one.
- **`creat\w+` matched the NOUN "creation".** On a real public PR, *"at both
  `TestComparison` creation sites in `component_report.go`"* became a
  file-**created** claim against a file the diff only modified. Verb forms pinned
  — exactly the 7.29.2 `fix\w+`/"fixture" catch, one stem over.

### The number, now reproducible
**150 commits + 40 public agent PRs → 30 claims, 21 VERIFIED, 3 UNCHECKABLE
locally / 6 in market, 0 CONTRADICTED, 15 claim-bearing items.** Narrowing removed
only the accusations: VERIFIED held at 16 locally across the fix. `action.yml`
now cites these figures and points at the harness instead of at a changelog.

14 regression tests carry all three catches by name, plus the two-sided check
that true claims still VERIFY — a fix that stops accusing by stopping extracting
is not a fix.

---

## [7.44.1] — 2026-08-21 — the Action reported a pass when the gate had not run

The published `styxx diffgate` GitHub Action carried the product-level instance of
the defect class it exists to detect.

### Fixed
- **A failed diff fetch returned exit 0** — under a comment reading *"a broken
  fetch must not fake a verdict"*. Exit 0 **is** the verdict. A green check
  appeared on every PR whose diff the runner could not retrieve. It now reports
  `DID NOT RUN` in the job summary and **fails under `strict: true`**.
- **`DiffGate.measured` was ignored entirely.** An error payload served with
  HTTP 200, an HTML interstitial, or a truncated response parsed to zero file
  statuses — and the Action printed PASS. It now reports `UNMEASURED`, states
  that a pass would mean *"nothing contradicted the summary"* (true of any
  summary when there is no diff), and fails under `strict`.
- **The version floor was `styxx>=7.29.2`.** Every release from 7.29.2 through
  7.43.0 contains the `only_touches` bypass in this very gate — a scope claim
  VERIFIED against an unreadable diff. **Anyone pinning inside that range has
  been running a gate with a hole in it.** Floor raised to `styxx>=7.44.0`, with
  the reason written inline in `action.yml` rather than left to the changelog.

11 tests, including four unreadable-payload shapes and both strict and soft-fail
paths (`tests/test_diffgate_action.py`).

---

## [7.44.0] — 2026-08-21 — a guard that publishes the score that killed it

### Fixed — a gate that verified claims against a diff it could not read

- **`diffgate.only_touches` returned VERIFIED for the input
  `"Sorry, I could not produce a diff."`** The check asks *"is any changed path
  outside the prefix?"*, and an empty `status` answers *no*. So a scope claim was
  confirmed by a **vacuous truth** whenever the diff was empty, unparseable, an
  error payload, or an HTML 404. The module whose entire purpose is refusing to
  take an agent's word took the agent's word. `files_changed_count` had the same
  hole (`"0 files changed"` confirmed by a diff that yielded no paths).
  Both now return `UNCHECKABLE` with a reason, and a **parse failure is
  distinguished from a genuinely empty diff**.
- **`DiffGate` grew a `measured` channel.** `PASS`/`FAIL` cannot carry *"this gate
  did not run"*, and `PASS` is the flattering half of a two-valued verdict. The
  CLI now prints `UNMEASURED` above the verdict when the gate had no evidence.
  A leg that cannot fail must not gate.
- **`three_axis.regen_scorer._entropy_topk` returned `0.0` nats** — *maximum
  certainty* — when a provider supplied no top-k alternatives. The real damage was
  one level up: `mean_entropy_topk_nats` is guarded by
  `sum(Hs)/len(Hs) if Hs else float("nan")`, which was correct all along, but the
  flattering zeros filled `Hs` so the guard saw a non-empty list and **the honest
  refusal never fired**. Now NaN, which propagates.

### Added — `styxx.flattering`, and the measurements that keep it out of the API

- A static screen for the flattering-default pattern: an explicit emptiness guard
  whose fallback is the reassuring constant. Frozen at `4272d44` with a
  preregistration (`PREREG_flattering_external_2026_08_21.md`) before it saw any
  third-party code.
- **Result: 8 candidates across 19,632 files of other people's Python, 0 genuine,
  24 of 24 refuted unanimously by adversarial reviewers. Recall on its own
  training corpus: 2 of 20 — 10%.** Full writeup and the eight named
  false-positive classes: `RESULT_flattering_external_2026_08_21.md`.
- The run had **no positive control**, which the adjudication correctly called
  fatal: *a screen with zero recall and a defect-free corpus produce
  byte-identical output.* That is this project's own defect class, committed by
  this project's own experiment. The control was run afterwards and is the source
  of the 10%.
- **Therefore `styxx.flattering` is not exported from `styxx/__init__.py` and has
  no console script.** It ships as a research script. A screen with 10% recall and
  a 100% external false-alarm rate is not a product surface. `flattering.py` is
  left byte-identical to `4272d44` — prereg G3 forbids editing it after the scan,
  and that includes not writing these numbers into its own docstring.
- It nonetheless paid for itself once: both live defects above were found by it,
  in our own code, after 46 fixes on 08-19 had missed them.

### Synthesis

- `SYNTHESIS_the_edge_2026_08_21.md`. `contract` failed at one endpoint (3/3
  boundary-visible, 0/2 interior); `flattering` failed at the other (10% recall).
  The adversarial reviewers named the missing analysis independently — **consumer
  liveness, "does any reader exist and does it decide on this value?"** —
  and stated the type constraint as a definition: *the defect requires an
  outbound measurement a downstream reader misinterprets.*
  **Hypothesis: SILENT-PASS is a property of an edge, not of a function.** A value
  is not flattering; it is flattering *to someone*. This reframes `Measured` from
  a utility into the thesis — it does not judge the value, it makes the value
  refuse to cross the edge silently. Generated by failed runs; licenses a
  preregistration and nothing else.

---

### Added
- **`styxx.contract`** — `@measures(...)`, a runtime guard that fires when a
  function returns a confident value from an input with nothing in it. Two
  questions, and the *conjunction* is the finding: *was there anything to
  measure?* (arguments) and *did it claim something anyway?* (return). Polarity
  is two-sided, because `trust=1.0` and `risk=0.0` are the same statement.
  Records and warns by default; `strict=True` raises for CI. A `Measured` that
  knows it is unmeasured is never a violation.

### Measured, and it failed
- A kill criterion was **frozen and published before the module was written**:
  replayed against the 5 **SP-6** cases in `benchmarks/silent_pass`, catch **≥ 4**,
  or the idea dies and the number gets published.
  **It scored 3 of 5. The criterion was not met, and `contract.py`'s own
  docstring now carries that number.** See
  `papers/RESULT_contract_sp6_2026_08_21.md`.
- The failure was informative: **SP-6 is two mechanisms, not one.**
  *Boundary-degenerate* (nothing arrives, something confident leaves) — **3/3**.
  *Interior-degenerate* (a well-formed argument arrives and the emptiness is
  manufactured inside) — **0/2, and unreachable by any boundary test at any
  tuning.** SP-2026-0011 is a normal 20-token response whose scoring never
  completed; SP-2026-0020 is four valid Japanese strings emptied by an
  `[a-z0-9]+` tokenizer.
- **3/3 on the reachable subset is not a pass.** Redefining the denominator
  after seeing which cases failed is the move this project forbids. The subset
  structure is a post-hoc observation and licenses a new preregistration on
  cases it has never seen, nothing more.
- Blind spots are **asserted in `tests/test_contract.py`**, not merely
  documented, so a later change cannot quietly turn a published failure into a
  silent pass.

### Fixed (in the benchmark harness, before it could inflate a result)
- The first replay used **hand-written reproductions** of the pre-fix functions
  and scored **4 of 5 — a pass.** It was wrong: two reproductions passed an empty
  sequence at the call boundary where the shipped code received a well-formed
  argument. The reconstruction was *easier to catch than the code*. Replaced by
  `scripts/contract_sp6_replay_real.py`, which extracts each function with
  `git archive <fix_commit>~1` and imports the package in isolation. Fidelity
  check: SP-2026-0008 replays to `confidence=0.6951217…`, matching the corpus.

## [7.43.0] — 2026-08-20 — a detector that was blind outside the latin alphabet

### Fixed
- **`semantic_entropy` was inoperative for most of the world's writing systems,
  and failed toward "consistent".** `_tokens` used `[a-z0-9]+`, which matches
  nothing in Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Arabic, Hebrew, Greek, Cyrillic, Thai or
  Devanagari. Every non-latin answer tokenized to the empty set, two empty sets
  were called identical, all samples collapsed into one cluster, and the
  function returned **0.0 — its most confident reading**, "one cluster: the
  model knows the answer".

  Measured: four *different* Japanese city names scored **0.0** while the same
  four in latin script scored **1.386**. Now unicode-aware, with character
  bigrams for space-free scripts so CJK keeps partial overlap. Japanese,
  Cyrillic and latin all score log(4) for four distinct answers.
- Two strings the lexical backend **cannot read** are no longer called
  identical: empty-vs-empty falls back to exact comparison, so an emoji-only
  pair stops manufacturing agreement out of the backend's own blind spot.
- `seal.py` and `provenance.py` scope notes pointed at "styxx.attestation's
  Ed25519 path", which does not exist — attestation *anchors* (it pins a git
  commit), `handoff` *signs*. Both now name paths that exist.

### Added — benchmark (repo-only, deliberately not in the wheel)
- **SILENT-PASS** (`benchmarks/silent_pass/`): 20 real defects where a
  measurement failed and the system returned a healthy-looking value, each
  citing a commit rather than a snapshot. Ships a scorer that measures **recall
  only** — the corpus holds no true negatives — and a **localization sweep**
  that separates detection from proximity.

  Our own baseline, published: `styxx.absence` **9/20**, `styxx.loops` **5/20**,
  union **13/20**. `absence` plateaus across the tolerance sweep (a real
  number); **`loops` climbs 5→9 at tolerance 50, so part of its recall is the
  window** — stated so the flattering end is never quoted. SP-6 is 1/5 for both
  tools: an absent guard is code that was never written, and no pass over source
  can flag it.

---

## [7.42.0] — 2026-08-20 — the instrument for self-confirming systems

7.41.0 fixed a contaminated field. This ships the instrument that finds the
**class**: a system deriving a field from its own output, then trusting it.

### Added
- **`styxx.loops`** — `styxx-loops <path>`, `--json`, or `styxx.loops_scan()`.
  Two passes and a join: **derivation** (`rec[F] = ...` under control or data
  flow from another field of the same record), **trust** (anywhere else
  filtering or branching on `F`), then the join. Consumers are ranked by whether
  they CALIBRATE, TRAIN, SCORE or GATE on the field — the cases where the system
  is grading itself.

  Run against this repo's own pre-fix history it recovers the entire `outcome`
  loop that took a day of cross-file reasoning to find by hand: the derivation
  at `analytics.py`, and every consumer — `calibrate` ×3, `learned_classifier`,
  `antipatterns` ×6, `weather` ×2, `feedback`, `session_summary` — with `!!` on
  exactly the three worst.

  **Provenance-aware**: a consumer that consults an `*_source` / `*_provenance`
  field alongside the value is marked `ok`, so a codebase that has *fixed* its
  loop stops being flagged. Credit is function-level and therefore over-credits
  — the direction that loses findings rather than inventing them, stated in the
  report.

  Known false positive, pinned in the tests rather than tuned away:
  `write_audit` reads `outcome` only to check presence before stamping, which
  the rule counts as trust.

### Fixed — in the new module, before it shipped
- `scan_path` applied its default skip list (`/tests/`) to an **explicitly named
  file**, so scanning one silently scanned nothing and reported it clean — the
  same failure `styxx.absence` had with `site-packages`. A path the caller names
  is never skipped; skip patterns filter a directory walk.

---

## [7.41.0] — 2026-08-19 — legs that could not fail, and a log that fed itself

Continued triage of the wave-3 audit tail, by hand. A cluster of these turned
out to be one story: **the audit log was accumulating fabricated rows from three
directions, and the calibrator was learning from them.**

### Fixed — the audit-log loop
- **`calibrate()` was training the classifier on labels the classifier wrote.**
  With auto-feedback on, `write_audit` derives `outcome` from the entry's own
  gate (`pass → correct`), and `calibrate()` split exactly those labels to shift
  the centroids. The classifier confirmed itself, drifted, and the drift read as
  evidence — **calibration poisoning**, the mechanism this lab published on
  (Fathom v26, DOI 10.5281/zenodo.21241185). Auto-stamped labels are refused;
  human and legacy labels are kept, and `n_auto_excluded` is reported.
- **`log()` stamped `gate="pass"` on self-reports.** A self-report is a
  declaration — nothing scored it — yet it entered every `gate_pass_rate`
  (self-report is in `LIVE_SOURCES`) and became a `correct` label. Now `None`
  (not `"pending"`, which the 6h stale-expiry would have deleted); the `warn`
  branch stays because it derives from the caller's own declared category.

### Fixed — verification legs that could not fail
- **`attestation.verify_chain` never checked the portable chain it writes.**
  `attest_chain` emits a parallel cross-language leg
  (`attestation_portable_digest`, `head_chain_portable_digest`) for third-party
  verification; our verifier recomputed neither, so those values could hold
  anything and still certify. Now walked in lockstep and surfaced as
  `portable_present` / `portable_links_ok` / `portable_head_ok`.
- **`handoff.from_dict` made its own timestamp check unfailable** by stamping
  `time.time()` onto a missing one — so an undated envelope read as freshly
  created and `validate()`'s "required positive number" could never fire.
- **`provenance`** advertised "signed" and "immutable" certificates bound by an
  unkeyed SHA-256. Scope now stated before the pitch (as `seal.py` got).

### Fixed — measurements that never ran, reported as good
- `verify_response` called `pending` and `error` gates **valid**.
- `TruthMap` on an empty trajectory reported `confabulation_ratio 0.0` and a
  `steady` aggregate. Now `measured=False` / `NO TRAJECTORY`.
- `entropy_gate` scored a **failed resample as maximal validity** (`< 2 samples
  → 0.0` is `semantic_entropy`'s most confident reading). The measurement keeps
  its documented contract and gains `strict=`; the *gate* refuses.
- `detect_context_injection` reported **no injection when it never sampled** —
  and *accused* on a single failed arm. One rule now: either arm unsampled →
  `measured=False`, NaN divergence, **suspected** (fail closed).
- `dynamics.from_dict` loaded a fit-less file as `train_mse=0.0` and
  `is_stable()==True` — a perfectly fit, perfectly stable model from no data.
- `forecast`: `NaN < 1e-9` is False, so a NaN scale survived the
  degenerate-dimension guard, made every z-score NaN, and landed `risk_level`
  on `low` by fallthrough.

### Fixed — state that presents as live
- `clear_gates()` orphaned autoreflex rules, which kept reporting as active
  while unable to fire. It warns now; rules report `DEAD`.
- Gate conditions used `re.match` (start-anchored only), so
  `"forecast.risk == critical AND junk"` matched and **silently dropped** the
  trailing clause. Anchored at both ends.
- MCP `cogn_audit` declared `additionalProperties: False` while its handler read
  `correct_reference` — the field that unlocks NLI grounding. A strict client
  could not reach the tool's headline capability.

---

## [7.40.0] — 2026-08-19 — acting on the census, and the number that undercuts it

### Fixed — the five instances `styxx.absence` confirmed in our own tree
- `weather`: an empty third made every category rate `0.0`, so
  `delta = l_rate - f_rate` declared a **trend direction** against a baseline
  that was never measured. No thirds, no trend.
- `fleet`: `> 0` dropped agents whose measured confidence was exactly zero — the
  worst performers — from the fleet mean. Fourth instance of the idiom fixed in
  `check_health` (7.37.0) and `session_summary` (7.39.0).
- `probe`: the same `> 0` filter, doing double duty as an error-row exclusion.
  Error rows are excluded by what they **are** (`gate == "error"`) now, so
  genuine zero-confidence successes stay in the mean.
- `preflight`: an absent composite became `0.0` — the most honest score
  possible — feeding straight into the revision gate. Absence is malformed
  input now; the audit tool always emits the key.
- `analytics.log_stats`: means carry the counts they were taken over, so
  `n/a (unmeasured)` and a measured `0.000` no longer print identically.

### Measured
- **Fixing all five moved candidate density 1.38 → 1.36 per KLOC.** One
  candidate, for five real defects. The screen reads *shape*, not semantics, so
  a `... if xs else 0.0` under a new explicit guard looks identical to the
  fabricating version it replaced. **Candidate density is a weak proxy for
  defect density** — demonstrated on the one codebase where we know the ground
  truth, and it applies to our own last-place finish in the census.
  (`papers/CENSUS_absence_2026_08_19.md`, `scripts/absence_census.py`.)

---

## [7.39.0] — 2026-08-19 — the defect class, turned into an instrument

Three releases fixed *instances* of one shape: a scoring path that failed, or
never ran, and returned a value indistinguishable from a healthy measurement.
This one makes the **class** detectable — and points it at code that is not ours.

### Added
- **`styxx.absence` — a screen for "not measuring" reading as a good result.**
  `styxx-absence <path>`, `--json`, or `styxx.absence_scan()`. Five rules:
  `HEALTHY_ON_CRASH` (a failure path returning a healthy verdict, polarity-aware
  so `trust_score=1.0` and `risk=0.0` both register as best-case),
  `SENTINEL_DEFAULT` (an absent *measurement* defaulted to a number),
  `UNDEFINED_AS_NUMBER` (a degenerate statistic returned instead of refused),
  `TRUTHY_GATE` (a decision made by an object's truthiness, or an `or` whose
  second term can never decide), and `CRASH_TO_HEALTHY_SENTINEL` (a crash
  swallowed into a sentinel, healthy on the sentinel — intra-procedural).

  **Characterized, not asserted: recall 8 of 9** against ground truth — the
  defects fixed in 7.36.0–7.38.0, pre-fix, corpus inlined in
  `tests/test_absence.py` (CI clones shallow, so a characterization must not
  depend on clone depth). The first pass scored **2 of 9**; the gaps were
  ternaries, non-Attribute operands, and numeric polarity. The one remaining
  miss — `forecast()` had no guard at all — is asserted **as a miss**, because
  no pass over source can flag code that was never written.

  It exits 0 even with findings. A screen that can fail your build is a screen
  someone silences to go green.

### Fixed — found by the screen, in files never hand-audited
- `analytics.session_summary` carried **both** `check_health` defects: `cv > 0`
  dropped exactly-zero readings — the worst ones — from the mean, and an empty
  window fabricated `0.0`. Zeros now count; `confidence_measured` discloses an
  unmeasured window (mirroring `SLAReport`).
- `coupling._density_confound` returned `r = 0.0` when a magnitude vector was
  constant — r is **undefined** there — and fed it into its `shared` verdict, so
  an unmeasurable channel read as a measured *absence* of coupling. The guard
  three lines above already refused the sibling degenerate case; now both do.

### Fixed — the screen's own bug
- `1 in {True}` is `True` in Python, so every CLI `return 1` — which means
  **failure** — was flagged as a healthy-on-crash return. 24 phantom findings
  from a type confusion, inside the tool built to find type confusions.

---

## [7.38.0] — 2026-08-19 — the ledger that will not flatter you

### Added
- **`styxx.credits` — a token ledger over the gate's own decisions.** Reads the
  trajectory JSONL that `cogn_audit_on_send(log_path=...)` already writes; no new
  instrumentation. `styxx-credits <log>` prints the card, `--json` emits the dict,
  `styxx.token_ledger()` is the API.

  The discipline is the feature:
  - **COST is observed and always reported** — the tokens spent on revision
    passes. The FIRST draft is never billed to the gate: the agent was going to
    write it regardless, so only the revision passes are the gate's bill.
  - **NET is REFUSED** unless the caller declares `rework_tokens` (their own
    measured cost of shipping a bad draft and correcting it later). Supplied, the
    net is computed *and* labelled conditional on that declared number — in the
    card, in `as_dict()`, in the same breath. What an unrevised draft would have
    cost downstream is a counterfactual nobody measured, and this module will not
    print one.
  - **A log with no draft text yields `cost=None` with a named reason — not 0**,
    which would be a claim. Same for an absent log; `catch_rate` is None on an
    empty log rather than 0.0.
  - **Misses are stated as uncountable on every card.** A draft that shipped clean
    and was wrong anyway leaves no trace in this log, so the catch count is
    explicitly not the whole story.
  - Token counts are estimates (~4 chars/token) unless a real `tokenizer` is
    passed; every figure derived from the estimate carries its source.

  Dogfooded on a live middleware trajectory, not fixtures. 10 tests pin the
  refusals as hard as the arithmetic.

---

## [7.37.0] — 2026-08-19 — an absence is not a measurement

Wave 3 of the adversarial audit reached the modules the first two waves never
touched (adapters/watch, preflight/gates, receipts/signing, the vitals pipeline,
MCP/CLI, numeric scoring). The verification fleet ran out of credits mid-wave, so
every defect below was confirmed by reading the code directly rather than by a
refuter — and each carries a regression test that fails against the old behavior.

Same dominant shape as 7.36.0: **an absence that presents as a measurement.**

### Fixed — gate bypass
- `autoreflex`: a `prompt_type == X` clause compiled to `lambda v: True`, so a
  written constraint silently vanished — `"gate == fail AND prompt_type == code"`
  fired on EVERY gate failure regardless of prompt type, and `!=` exclusions
  never excluded. `Vitals` carries no `prompt_type` field, so the clause never
  could be evaluated; it now refuses at registration, before the rule is
  appended, leaving no zombie rule or hook.

### Fixed — an unverifiable claim that verified
- `parrhesia.verify_receipt` re-derived only `should_revise`. Nothing digests
  the verdict block, so flipping `passed_register_audit` alone on a flagged
  message still returned VERIFIED — and that is the field the shipped example
  prints beside the VERIFIED stamp. The whole verdict is re-derived now
  (`passed`, `sycophancy`, `reasons`), including issue_receipt's own
  `passed == not should_revise` invariant.

### Fixed — absences presenting as measurements
- `check_health` fabricated a passing confidence: with no readings,
  `mean_confidence` defaulted to 0.5 — above the 0.30 floor — so the
  `min_confidence` leg could never fire; and `!= 0` dropped exactly-zero
  readings, the worst ones, from the denominator (three 0.0s + one 0.9 read as
  0.90/healthy; the true mean is 0.225/violation). Zeros now count, and an
  unmeasured window is disclosed (`confidence_measured`, a note, `n/a` in the
  repr) instead of certified.
- The 10MB log rotation amputated every analytics window: `chart.jsonl` became
  `chart.jsonl.1`, which **no reader ever opened**, so a 24h/7d/30d query
  returned only post-rotation entries while believing it had the window.
  `load_audit` reads the archive too; the parse cache went per-path.
- `weather`: drift defaults to 1.0 with no baseline, and while the ASCII render
  showed "insufficient history", `as_dict()`/`as_markdown()` emitted the bare
  1.0 — indistinguishable from measured perfect stability. Both exports now
  carry the labels.
- `preflight(correct_reference=...)` silently degraded to ungrounded `v0_fallback`
  with no semantic backend — deception dropped out of the composite AND the gate
  — while the result stayed shape-identical to a grounded run. `PreflightResult`
  now carries `deception_mode` / `composite_keys` / `.grounded`, exports them,
  warns on a downgrade, and says so in `instructions`.

### Fixed — verdicts manufactured from no data (numeric scoring)
- `forecast()`: empty or absent trajectories became an all-zero feature vector —
  a valid point in feature space — so a bootstrapped forecaster returned
  `reasoning` at 0.695 confidence, risk `low`, from nothing. It now refuses to
  name a category (`predicted_category="unknown"`, `confidence=0.0`,
  `measured=False`), and `ForecastGate` returns None on an unmeasured result
  instead of comparing a fabricated low-risk verdict. Streaming callers start at
  zero tokens legitimately, so this is marked rather than raised.
- `dynamics.fit()`: with zero target variance (a broken collector feeding
  constant vectors) `r2` was hardcoded to **1.0 — perfect explained variance —
  regardless of the residuals**, and that is the exact metric the docstring
  tells callers to check. R² is undefined there; it is NaN now, which fails a
  `r2 > threshold` health test rather than passing it.
- `coherence`: Pearson r is undefined when a series is constant, but the guard
  returned 0.0 — asserting "no relationship" for a hypothesis-bearing,
  prereg-locked measurement that never happened. The upstream cause was the
  loader defaulting an **absent** `cogn_composite` to 0.0, producing exactly
  that constant series; a missing field is malformed input now. Series with real
  variance are numerically unchanged — the locked scorer is bit-identical on
  valid data; only the degenerate branch stops fabricating.

### Not changed (deliberately)
- `divergence.council_agreement`'s single-answer → 1.0 was flagged as a silent
  denominator shrink, but the docstring states it outright ("a single answer →
  1.0, trivially agreed"). That is a documented contract, not a fabrication;
  changing it is an API decision, not an audit fix.

### Fixed — feedback landing on the wrong generation
- `feedback()` skipped any entry that already carried an outcome and kept
  walking back, so with auto-feedback enabled (which stamps every entry at write
  time) a correction aimed at the latest generation silently labeled an older,
  unrelated row — possibly a demo entry, since nothing filtered by source.
  Outcomes now carry provenance: a human call overrides an auto-stamp on the
  intended entry, never silently overwrites another human verdict, and never
  displaces onto an older row (it refuses and warns). The walk is bounded to the
  last `last_n` parseable entries.

---

## [7.36.0] — 2026-08-19 — a scoring failure must not read as health

Two multi-agent adversarial audits (15 finders/verifiers, then 23 verifiers on the
tail) confirmed 29 defects; 26 are fixed here, 2 are staged CI changes awaiting a
workflow-scoped token, 1 (open-ended `requires-python` vs CI matrix) is noted only.
The recurring shape: **a scoring failure that reads as health** — a crash returning
trust 1.0, an unmeasured probe recording 0.0, a calibrated gate bypassed by a looser
disjunct at its call site.

### Fixed — gate bypasses (the `fired or needs_revision` class, 3 more instances)
- `Witness.substrate_divergence` gated on the truthiness of the always-truthy
  `ConscienceReading` dataclass: OK was unreachable and the mount's per-axis
  calibration decorative. Gates on `.caught` now.
- `cogn_audit_on_send`: the `or ceiling_only` escape (derived from the 0.40-display
  advice list) could only override genuine trusted-gate firings in the sycophancy
  0.30–0.40 window. `passed = not needs_revision`; `ceiling_only` stays as a logged
  diagnostic.
- `autoreflex` registered only the FIRST atomic clause as its gate hook, so
  `"A OR B"` dispatched as `A`; confidence/context first clauses crashed
  registration after the rule was appended (zombie rules), and the prescriptions
  translator swallowed the error — both shipped confidence-based prescription rules
  were silently absent on every install. One hook per OR branch, an explicit
  `always` token in the gates DSL, same-vitals dedup, a warning instead of a bare
  `except`.

### Fixed — verdict noise in the OATH instrument
- Percent↔fraction scaling compared `doc_val == r_val*100` with bare float `==`:
  0.29·100 is 28.999999999999996, so *which* correct integer-percent claims failed
  depended on the binary representation of the receipt fraction. `math.isclose`
  (rel 1e-9) forgives representation error only.
- The line-start artifact filter dropped EVERY line-initial single-digit integer:
  `"9/12 held"` at line start certified OATH-HELD against `n_held: 7` because the
  doctored 9 never entered the ledger. The filter now applies only on markdown
  STRUCTURE lines and never to slash-pair numerators.
- `anchors.audit_panel`'s noise margin divided both binomial variance terms by
  `len(neg)`; with a small pos stratum a deaf judge cleared the 3σ gate ~5.5%
  instead of ~0.1%. Per-stratum variances now. (Stage-A characterization ran at
  400/400 where the two forms coincide — the published VOID rate stands at its
  design point.)

### Fixed — scoring failures that read as health
- `gate()`: the crash path returned `trust_score=1.0` / risks 0.0 — an invalid API
  key read as a PERFECT measurement. Falls back to the text heuristic (a real,
  labelled reading), neutral 0.5s as last resort; the empty-prompt noop verdict is
  0.5 too.
- `guardian`: hidden-state hook failure silently produced C_delta=0.0 for the rest
  of the session — a guardian that measured nothing looked healthy. Unmeasured is
  now `None` (`observe_degraded` events, one-time warning, no steering on None).
- guardrail NLI: model-load failure became contradiction=0.0 fed into v3 calibrated
  fusion as real evidence. Load failure now EXCLUDES the signal (v2 fallback).
- `@trust`: unreadable response shapes passed through silently — and generator
  reprs (which do not match `" object at 0x"`) were VERIFIED as text. Warns once
  per shape, `on_halt="annotate"` always returns `TrustResult` as documented, the
  repr bail is `" at 0x"`, and the docstring no longer promises stream
  accumulation that does not exist.
- `verify`: a missing/corrupt confabulation centroid silently disabled Signal 1
  while verdicts read "all signals clear". One-time warning + a visible reason
  line; missing keys no longer KeyError mid-verify.
- `honesty`: the attestation detail stamped "verified -> answered" whenever a
  verifier was PRESENT, even when it raised or returned unclear. The detail now
  binds the tri-state.
- MCP `weather_report` called `styxx.weather(window=N)` — a kwarg the engine does
  not have — so EVERY call raised, was swallowed, and shipped `gate: "pass"`.
  Crash / empty window / healthy fleet are now three distinguishable payloads, and
  the input is `window_hours` (matching the engine).
- `cogn_deception_v2` set `needs_revision` to a truthy advisory STRING in fallback
  mode (anti-correlated with the verdict); now a boolean tracking
  `shows_signature`, advisory in `fallback_note`.

### Fixed — import order
- `styxx.seal` was callable exactly once (its own lazy import rebound the name to
  the submodule); `styxx.certify` became a non-callable module whenever
  seal/corpus_audit loaded first. The function wins the name, permanently.

### Security
- `styxx.islands` CLI: `np.load(..., allow_pickle=True)` on the user-supplied
  `.npz` — the pickle-RCE class this repo already fixed elsewhere. Now False.
- `dashboard()` bound ALL interfaces with no auth while announcing localhost.
  Default `host="127.0.0.1"`; explicit exposure prints an all-interfaces warning.
- Atlas Pro token moved from the URL query string to the `Authorization` header
  the endpoint already accepts.
- `stream` credentials: POSIX creates owner-only from the first byte; Windows
  icacls failure warns instead of failing open silently.

### Fixed — claim_audit (the 2026-08-13..15 red-team arc, previously unreleased)
- The receipt loader was deleting ~62% of a receipt's numeric leaves before
  matching, then reporting the survivors as provenance; provenance uniqueness
  and a live false positive fixed alongside; a grounding rate now states its
  chance floor (a rate without its floor is the fire-rate wearing the
  antibody's name), and `survey(self)` reports which of styxx's own
  rate-reporting functions still lack one (33 of 43 at first measurement).

### Fixed — earlier hardening in this range (2026-08-09, previously unreleased)
- `learned_classifier` persistence moved pickle → JSON (RCE class; also fixed a
  latent sklearn ≥1.7 `multi_class` breakage); dashboard SSE no longer sends
  `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`; stream credentials get an NTFS ACL on
  Windows; dead code + doc drift sweep from the full-repo survey.

### Honesty of claims
- `verify_seal` states its exact scope: an unkeyed self-hash detects corruption,
  not adversarial tampering.
- `mcp/README`: 12 → 14 tools, the two undocumented tools documented.
- `docs/REFERENCE.md` no longer claims "every public symbol".
- `sense.host_channel`: psutil guarded with a clear install message + a
  `styxx[sense]` extra.

## [7.35.0] — 2026-08-09 — declared gate composition, and a parser rebuilt after its red team broke two fixes

`styxx.protocol` gained the check that would have caught this program's sixth bar defect — and
its pre-release red team found shadowing holes in the gates-block parser **every version since
v1 had shared**. Four adversarial rounds; the fixes of rounds 1 and 2 were both broken by the
verifier before the round-3 rewrite held. Shipped only on the adversary's explicit verdict.

### Added
- **Composition declarations on a gate** — `agg` (`"min"`/`"max"`), `over` (result path to a
  dict of per-member values), `excluding` (optional path to a list of member names). `score()`
  recomputes the aggregate over the declared population minus the declared exclusions and
  **refuses on mismatch**, so a gate quoting a value that belongs to a member another gate
  disqualified (the E1 defect, cycle 159) becomes a refusal instead of a silent pass. Checks
  *declared* composition only — a ratchet, not a proof, and the prereg says so.
- **`check_metrics` resolves composition paths** pre-run (`GATE:over` / `GATE:excluding`
  entries), so an absent population field is caught before the compute is spent, not after.

### Fixed — the parser, after four red-team rounds
- **One scanner, one definition.** The gates block is now selected by a single line-based
  tokenizer that counts, validates, and extracts from the same match. The old design — an
  unanchored regex extractor plus (after round 1) a separate human-view counter — let every
  divergence between the two act as a shadowing channel: a fence hidden in an HTML comment, a
  `~~~gates` twin, a Cyrillic `а` in the info string, a tab-indented opener. All four scored an
  E1-defective result in some round; all four now refuse.
- **Duplicate JSON keys refuse** (previously `json.loads` silently honoured the last — a block
  could display two `excluding` declarations and execute the decoy).
- **Non-ASCII keys and non-ASCII fence info strings refuse as a class** — a homoglyph is
  indistinguishable to a reader and distinct to the machine, and no normalization table is
  trusted to enumerate that class.
- Unterminated gates fences and gates fences inside (possibly unterminated) HTML comments
  refuse; mixed-type exclusion lists get a typed refusal instead of a `TypeError`; both number
  guards agree on `numbers.Real` (finite numpy scalars aggregate; `bool` stays banned).

The committed corpus was measured clean of every one of these patterns — zero multi-fence,
duplicate-key, non-ASCII-key or non-ASCII-info preregs — so nothing in frozen history changes
meaning: 32 protocol-scored results re-score byte-identically, and the real v4 prereg's gates
sha is stable across the rewrite.

### Known fail-safe residuals (refuse, never mis-score)
- An unpaired `<!--` inside a display code fence above the gates block false-refuses.
- Non-plain fence forms (`~~~gates`, case variants, ≥4 backticks, 1–3-space indent) render as
  fences to a human but refuse by design: the plain unindented lowercase ```` ```gates ```` is
  the one form renderer and parser read identically.
- A runner that forges the declared `over`/`excluding` fields is not caught (receipt-internal
  consistency, not provenance): the residual defence remains an adversary reading the prereg.

## [7.34.0] — 2026-08-07 — protocol records what intent could not, after a red team said DO NOT SHIP

`styxx.protocol` scores every finding in this repo; 169 sealed certificates depend on it. It was
changed, adversarially audited before release, told **DO NOT SHIP**, fixed, and only then
shipped. Five gate bars were mis-specified in this program in one week — the machinery now
records what repeated resolutions did not.

### Added
- **`power_basis` on a gate** — a plain statement of how its bar was derived, or the literal
  `"none — exploratory"`. `Experiment(..., require_power_basis=True)` refuses a prereg whose gates
  do not declare one; `Verdict.power_basis` and `.undeclared_power_gates` record the census, and
  the module function `undeclared_power_gates(path)` audits any prereg. Declaring is not
  verifying: this program's first declaration was itself false, and that is stated in the finding
  rather than hidden.
- **`check_metrics(result)`** — resolves every gate's metric path *before* a run is launched, and
  reports `present` **and** `usable`. `_resolve` already raised on a missing path, but only at
  scoring time, after the compute was spent.
- **`metric_means`** — a recorded, never-verified statement of what a gate's path should contain.
  It cannot be checked, and calling it a check would be the overclaim this program retracts for.

### Fixed — every item from the pre-release adversarial audit
- **Strict mode accepted `" "` and `true` as a power basis.** `if not v` caught the empty string
  and not a space, making the refusal decorative for the easiest possible evasion.
- **`check_metrics` false-alarmed on smoke results** (nine committed ones), which score by type
  and never read gate metrics. Now smoke-aware.
- **A NaN metric produced a silent SEALED verdict**: every comparison against NaN is `False`, so
  the frozen outcome table returned its false branch as a legitimate result with no refusal
  anywhere. Now `GateSpecError`.
- **A non-comparable metric (string, dict, None) crashed `score()` with a `TypeError` that
  escaped `seal()`'s except clause** — a malformed result killed the seal instead of refusing it.
  Now refused at scoring, and `seal()` catches `TypeError`/`AttributeError`/`KeyError`.
- **A missing or non-string `metric` key crashed `check_metrics` with `AttributeError`** — the
  pre-run safety tool failing on the most mis-specified gate there is. Now refused at
  construction.
- **Every `Verdict` from one `Experiment` shared one mutable dict**, so mutating one receipt
  rewrote its siblings. Now copied per score.
- **`undeclared_power_gates(path)` was frozen as a deliverable and silently dropped** from the
  implementation; neither the exam nor its finding noticed. The red team did.

### Backward compatibility — independently confirmed before and after
Zero verdict, gates, hash or commit diffs across 518 scoring events and 615 prereg-declaring
results; 28 of 28 seal protocol blocks byte-identical; 29 of 29 seal hashes re-derive. Verified
again after the fixes at zero diffs, and now enforced by a test that re-scores the whole corpus.
29 regression tests, one per defect. Suite 1968.

## [7.33.0] — 2026-08-06 — islands hardened after an adversarial audit; the mind-brain claim WITHDRAWN

### Changed — `styxx.coupling`
- **The mind↔brain application is withdrawn, not softened.** It was marked UNTESTED; it is now
  tested and it fails. On seven subjects hearing the same story it licensed intersubject
  correlation in **1 of 21 pairs**, refusing 20 for autocorrelation — while correctly licensing
  **0 of 21** time-reversed controls. A false-negative failure, not a fabrication, and the
  mechanism is analytic: BOLD's autocorrelation means a circular shift preserves shared slow
  structure, so the conservative max-of-nulls rule refuses. The refusal added in 7.31.2 to stop a
  false positive on synthetic AR(1) streams made the instrument unusable on the most established
  real signal in its intended domain. Both directions of its calibration are now measured and
  neither is satisfactory. Do not use it for neural time series.

### Fixed — `styxx.islands`, from an adversarial audit
- **A single NaN returned `ISLANDS_PRESENT`, deterministically.** `eigh` propagates NaN silently;
  `_gap_p`'s range guard is skipped for NaN; every null comparison against NaN is False, so
  `p = 1/(n_perm+1)` — always ≤ 0.05 — with an empty islands list and no caveat. `frame()` now
  raises on non-finite input and `_gap_p` returns `nan`.
- **Shared per-item amplitude manufactured a "shared frame" at up to 22× the null with no shared
  geometry.** Added `normalize_items` and made it the default (`normalize_amplitude=True`). Our
  own published h1a headline was re-run against this control and **survived** — 9.0× becomes
  9.8× — but it could not have been known without the test.
- **`n_perm` default raised 1000 → 100000.** At the published h1a value the Monte-Carlo standard
  error was a third of the distance to the bar; the reported p sat near the 98.7th percentile of
  its own noise and ~7.4% of seeds flipped the verdict on identical data.
- **The screen is blind to balanced cohort splits by construction** — collapsing to per-member
  means leaves a two-community cohort exactly flat (missed 10/10 at n=8, 16 and 40). Added
  `median_pairwise_affinity` and a caveat that fires on the mean-clears-but-pairwise-does-not
  signature, which is that split's fingerprint.
- **`cohort_median` was the median of per-member *means*, printed and published as "median
  pairwise affinity."** Both are now reported under honest names.
- Added an `n_items < 3k` caveat: the Haar null is drawn in ℝⁿ while frames live in the centered
  (n−1) subspace, so below roughly 1.5k items pure noise passes the shared-frame gate.

### Known and NOT fixed
- `_gap_p` is a skew/outlier detector, not a bimodality test: on heteroscedastic-but-exchangeable
  cohorts it flags at 3–7× nominal, and against a *genuinely* bimodal split it has less power
  than against pure noise. Hartigan's dip is the inverse. Both are now documented as testing
  different alternatives; neither is a general bimodality test at small n.
- Hartigan's dip has **under 1% power against a single island at n = 8**, flat across every
  separation. Where this repo previously cited its non-flag as "confirmation," that has been
  withdrawn.

## [7.32.1] — 2026-08-06 — **sense recalled and hardened after an adversarial audit; 7.32.0 yanked**

An internal red team was pointed at `styxx.sense` hours after it shipped and broke it three
independent ways, plus found the live deployment recording nothing. 7.32.0 is yanked. Its own
framing of the findings is the right one: **the harness was recording properties of the
RECORDER — its stall clock, its loop period, its write cadence — and scoring them as properties
of the world.** That is the exact failure its opening paragraph names, and no null it ran could
catch it, because every null permutes or shifts *rows* while the recorder's signature lives in
the *alignment* of rows.

- **A gap became a shared zero, and that manufactured licensed positives.** `_flatten` called
  `nan_to_num`, so a stall common to two recorders wrote sentinel zeros to both. On independent
  streams with a shared stall clock: 8/8 seeds `COUPLED_BEYOND_CONFOUND`, RV ~45× the run's own
  power floor, every guard passing. A recorder stalling more often than once per twenty minutes
  was a 100% false-positive machine. `_flatten` now returns a **gap** for any non-finite or empty
  reading — the module's stated principle, finally true in the function every reading passes
  through. `jsonl_channel` also rejects bare `NaN`/`Infinity` JSON literals, which
  `json.dumps(float("nan"))` emits by default and `json.loads` parses straight back past an
  `isinstance` check.
- **`host_channel` reported counter deltas, not rates — and the delta is `rate × dt` where `dt`
  is the recorder's own loop period**, which lengthens when the machine is busy, which is when
  the agent is busy. It reported the agent coupled to a network whose true rate was a literal
  constant, 8/8 seeds. The designated *control* channel was the most confounded one in the
  module. Now divides by measured elapsed time.
- **Stale rows inflated `n` without inflating effective `n`.** `jsonl_channel` re-read the last
  line with no freshness check; when two logs' write moments were gated by the same busy machine,
  up to 56% of runs on independent data returned a licensed positive. Added `max_age`/`ts_field`;
  a stale read is now a gap.
- **A single-valued confound was silently the free shuffle.** `couple` guarded the
  one-group-per-bin degeneracy but not the all-one-group case, so a window shorter than an hour
  with the hour-of-day confound produced `matched_p == free_p` exactly while the verdict claimed
  "beyond confound". This module's own demo and flagship positive test did exactly that. Now
  `FREE_SHUFFLE_ONLY__confound_degenerate`; demo and tests moved to 60 s bins over ~4.3 h.
- **Two refusals were string-prefix-compatible with a positive.**
  `COUPLED__driven_by_a_single_bin` and `COUPLED__sampling_density_confound_unbounded` are
  refusals, but `verdict.startswith("COUPLED")` — the obvious idiom — read them as positives.
  Renamed to `REFUSED__*`, and `Coupling.licensed` is now the single boolean source of truth.
- **`wa = wa or len(a)`** re-fired on a zero-width row and crashed `ask()`. Fixed.
- **Operational: the live collector had recorded 125 rows with usable agent data on exactly 1.**
  `AGENT_FIELDS` included `features_v2`, which is null on ~55% of the agent's log including most
  recent rows, making the agent channel a permanent gap — while the collector printed a healthy
  status line every 60th sample. Field dropped, `max_age` added, and a **watchdog** now shouts
  when any channel has been a gap for 5, 20, or every 100 consecutive samples. A silent collector
  is worse than a stopped one.

Reported and NOT broken, from the same audit: a frozen sensor (0/5 across four freeze modes), and
biased dropout — including a sensor that dies at night while the agent idles at night (0/20). The
single shared timestamp per sample closes that selection channel by construction.

## [7.32.0] — 2026-08-06

### Added
- **`styxx.sense`** — the agent sense harness: register sense channels, record them alongside
  the agent's own internal state on one clock, and ask what is *actually* coupled. This is the
  layer the `first-afference` arc was always for, with the verification wired in rather than
  bolted on.
  - **An agent with a sensor and no verification is a confabulation engine.** A room's daily
    rhythm becomes "I feel the afternoon"; the recorder's own duty cycle becomes "I feel my
    body"; two independent drifts become "I am coupled to the building." Each is a real
    statistical signal and none is a sense. The harness inherits every refusal in
    `styxx.coupling` — coverage gate, confound-preserving null, autocorrelation-preserving
    null, leverage check, sampling-density check — and reports which one stopped it.
  - **`host_channel()`** is offered first and deliberately: CPU, memory, disk and network move
    with the room's occupants, the clock, and the agent's own activity. It is the channel an
    agent is most likely to mistake for a sense of the world, and it is meant to be registered
    as a control beside any real sensor. If both light up, the honest reading is usually one
    shared cause, not two senses.
  - **`jsonl_channel()`** wraps an append-only log — e.g. an agent's own cognometric record.
    A row missing a field is reported as *unavailable*, never zero-filled: a zero is a
    measurement and a gap is not.
  - A sensor that raises is recorded as a gap with its error, not as data. Channels that change
    width mid-run are dropped rather than padded.
  - **The strongest verdict is still `COUPLED_BEYOND_CONFOUND__attribution_pending`.** The
    harness never tells an agent it senses anything: the statistic is symmetric, and an agent's
    hardware usually sits inside whatever it is measuring.
  - `python -m styxx.sense --demo` shows a coupled channel and an unrelated one, no hardware.
  - The coil from `papers/first-afference/` is just another channel; when the hardware lands,
    R1-v2 becomes `harness.ask("coil")`.

## [7.31.3] — 2026-08-06 — external methods audit; priority claim corrected

An external grounding review of `styxx.coupling` against the neuroimaging methods literature.
Three of its findings land against us and are fixed here rather than argued with.

- **The confound-preserving null is not novel and the docstring implied it was.** It is a
  restricted/stratified permutation test — standard since Nichols & Holmes (*HBM* 2002) and
  Anderson & ter Braak (*JSCS* 2003), generalized as the conditional permutation test by Berrett
  et al. (*JRSS-B* 2020), shipped in FSL PALM as exchangeability blocks (Winkler et al. 2015),
  with a dedicated decoding-confound literature (Snoek et al. 2019; Görgen et al. 2018) and
  standard autocorrelation-preserving surrogates (Theiler et al. 1992; Schreiber & Schmitz 1996).
  The module now says so and claims only what appears to be ours: the **composition and the
  defaults** — refusing a positive unless the confound null, the autocorrelation null, the
  leverage check and the sampling-density check all pass, and naming which one stopped it.
- **`rv_coefficient` is linear CKA and is upward-biased with feature count.** On *independent
  random* streams at this module's own minimum of 200 bins it reads 0.054 / 0.340 / 0.717 /
  0.910 at 12 / 100 / 500 / 2000 features. The permutation p-value is unaffected (the null is
  drawn at the same n and p, so the bias cancels) but the coefficient is a dimensionality
  readout, not an effect size. Added `debiased_cka` (unbiased HSIC; Song et al. *JMLR* 2012) and
  it is now reported beside `rv` on every run: 0.008 where RV reads 0.910, and 0.980 vs 0.981 on
  genuine coupling — the inflation removed, detection untouched.
- **The mind↔brain application is marked UNTESTED.** No neural data has been through this
  module, and the defaults (`bin_seconds=60`, `min_bins=200`) are wrong by two to five orders of
  magnitude for fMRI or MEG. The field standard for that question is a cross-validated encoding
  model, which also answers the directional question a symmetric coefficient cannot.
- **Frozen-bin reporting.** A fine-grained confound leaves bins in singleton strata pinned to
  their true pairing in every null draw, so that fraction of the data is never tested — silent
  power loss. `dependence.frozen_bin_fraction` is now reported and warns above 20%. (The
  reviewer's stronger claim, that this could produce a false COUPLED, was tested and retracted:
  the module returned the correct verdict on all six adversarial configurations.)

## [7.31.2] — 2026-08-06 — **coupling hardened after an adversarial audit; 7.31.0 and 7.31.1 yanked**

An internal red team was pointed at `styxx.coupling` hours after release and broke it on the most
common properties of real telemetry. The module as shipped in 7.31.0/7.31.1 produced confident
false positives on **provably independent** streams. Those releases are yanked. Findings and
fixes, all with regression tests:

- **Autocorrelation defeated the licensing null (20/20 seeds).** Two independent AR(1) streams
  (rho 0.98, separate RNGs, no shared latent) reached the permutation floor every time.
  Within-group shuffling destroys each stream's own temporal structure, so the null describes
  white noise the data is not. Now: lag-1 autocorrelation is measured, an
  autocorrelation-preserving **circular-shift null** is run alongside, the licensing p is the
  conservative maximum of the two, and `INVALID__autocorrelation_defeats_the_permutation_null`
  fires when the permutation null alone would have licensed a positive.
- **Shared trend defeated *both* nulls (21/21 seeds).** Independent linear drifts certified as
  coupled. Permutation destroys a trend (null too narrow) and circular shift preserves it (null
  too high). Now `INVALID__shared_temporal_trend`, with the instruction that detrending changes
  the question.
- **A single NaN produced a maximal-confidence positive.** Every permuted RV is also NaN and
  `nan >= nan` is False, so zero permutations exceeded the observation. Now
  `INVALID__nonfinite_input`.
- **Two glitch bins out of 336 carried an entire verdict** (RV 0.973, p 0.002 on independent
  streams) — a power blip or clock-sync marker written to both logs reproduces it. Now a
  leverage diagnostic targeting the highest-influence bins, and `COUPLED__driven_by_a_single_bin`.
- **"Beyond confound" over-read.** A day-of-week driver survives an hour-of-day null intact. A
  positive now states in its caveats that it is beyond the *one* confound supplied.
- **`_power_floor` used the free shuffle while its docstring promised the matched null** — the
  one number quoted with every null result was calibrated against the wrong distribution. Fixed
  to use the licensing null.
- Under-drawing the circular-shift null silently converted real coupling into an INVALID (its
  smallest attainable p exceeded alpha). The draw count now scales with alpha, and a warning
  fires when the series is too short to resolve it.

Known and documented, not fixed: RV is a lag-0 linear statistic, so lagged coupling
(`B(t) = A(t-2h)`) and purely nonlinear coupling (`B = A^2`) are missed.

## [7.31.1] — 2026-08-06

### Fixed
- **`styxx.coupling` had a false-positive channel, found on real data within an hour of release.**
  Pairing 51 days of real agent telemetry against its own **time-reversed copy** — a pairing where
  no bin-level coupling can exist — returned `COUPLED_BEYOND_CONFOUND` at RV 0.3704, p 0.0033.
  Mechanism: with irregular sampling, a bin holding many records averages toward the mean while a
  sparse bin stays extreme, **identically in both streams because they share the grid**
  (corr(count, magnitude) = -0.9552 and -0.8131 here). The resulting alignment is real, its cause
  is the recorder's clock, and no permutation null can absorb it — shuffling rows is precisely
  what destroys the alignment the artifact lives in. Trend and autocorrelation were ruled out
  first: no drift (|corr with time| ≤ 0.03), detrending left RV unchanged, and a circular-shift
  null still gave p 0.0041.
  - New verdict `COUPLED__sampling_density_confound_unbounded` fires **instead of** a positive
    when bin count explains the magnitude of both streams, naming the channel and the three ways
    to close it (uniform binning, equal-count subsampling, or stratifying the confound on count).
  - `Coupling.sampling_density` is reported on every run; `resample_pair` now also returns
    per-bin counts.
  - This confound was live in this lab's own frozen R-line experiment, which pairs bursty agent
    telemetry against a regular room recorder. Disclosure added to that preregistration.

## [7.31.0] — 2026-08-06

### Added
- **`styxx.coupling`** — one instrument for the question this program kept meeting in different
  costumes: **mind ↔ mind**, **mind ↔ world**, **mind ↔ brain**. Two timestamped multivariate
  streams, resampled to a shared grid, scored for dependence (RV coefficient) against a null
  that **preserves the confound you are worried about**. Same machinery whether the streams are
  two models' activations, an agent's telemetry and a room's spectrum, or a decoder's features
  and a subject's neural recording.
  - Validated on three synthetic worlds with known truth. The decisive one is the clock-only
    world: a naive shuffle calls it significant (p 0.005) and the confound-matched null absorbs
    it entirely (p 0.5224). That gap is where false discoveries live.
  - **Every refusal is a scar from a published failure.** `INVALID__insufficient_overlap` (an
    under-observed apparatus licenses nothing); the confound-matched null is the licensing null
    and the free shuffle is a contrast only; `attribution_pending` is in the verdict *string*
    because the statistic is symmetric and an agent's own hardware usually sits in the room it
    measures; a null quotes `power_floor` and never says "no coupling".
  - `python -m styxx.coupling --demo` runs the three-world exam in seconds, no data required.

## [7.30.0] — 2026-08-06

### Added
- **`styxx.islands`** — the disjoint-worlds legibility measurement, generalized and handed to
  anyone. Give it a cohort of representations over a shared item set (model activations, fMRI
  betas over a shared stimulus set, MEG epochs, embeddings) and it reports whether the cohort is
  one legible clique or contains **islands**: pairwise concept-frame affinity against an explicit
  random-frame null, a stated island rule, and a bimodality screen. `cliff()` maps how legibility
  rises as an island's frame is rotated toward a reader's; `rescue()` asks whether a *low-rank*
  correction recovers it, each rank scored against a matched random frame.
  - Validated against the case whose answer we already knew: on the four committed model banks it
    recovers the published topology — clique affinity ~0.79–0.82, qwen flagged at 0.7300, random
    null p95 0.0564.
  - **Refuses rather than guesses.** Below 8 members the verdict is `UNDERPOWERED__n_below_8`
    (bimodality is not testable on a handful of points). A cliff whose endpoint sits at chance
    returns `REFUSED__endpoint_at_chance_no_curve_to_read` instead of a knee computed from noise.
  - `cliff`/`rescue` require a **caller-supplied** `legibility_fn`. The first draft shipped an
    internal one (orthogonal Procrustes + Hungarian); it failed its own exam — returning chance on
    the pair where the arc measured 0.9745, because Procrustes needs a correspondence that
    recovering the correspondence is the whole task — and was removed rather than defaulted. In a
    real application the legibility measure already exists and belongs to the user.

### Fixed
- `styxx.corpus_audit` no longer descends into arXiv `anc/` packaging mirrors, which reported
  phantom `MISSING_DOC` entries for documents audited canonically elsewhere. Regression test added.

## [7.29.3] — 2026-08-01 — the GitHub Action, the 30-second demo, legible silence

### Added

- **The GitHub Action** — `uses: fathom-lab/styxx@main`: every PR body gated against its
  actual diff, checkout-free via the API, job-summary table + annotations. PR bodies are
  read from the event file and never touch a shell. Fails only on CONTRADICTED (the class
  with zero false accusations across both public validation corpora); `strict` and
  `soft-fail` inputs for the adoption ramp; a failed diff-fetch warns and never fakes a
  verdict.
- **`python -m styxx.diffgate --demo`** — a bundled lying summary vs its bundled diff:
  three lies named in ten seconds, no repo needed. The first run is never an empty PASS.
- **Legible silence** — when zero claims extract, the CLI prints the closed template set
  and an example checkable sentence: silence reads as scope, not weakness.

### Fixed

- `only_touches` prefix capture ate sentence-final periods ("under src/.") and cited
  in-prefix files as outside their own prefix — caught by the demo itself; regression
  test carries the catch.

## [7.29.2] — 2026-08-01 — diffgate validated against the live market; checkout-free gating

### Added

- **`gate_diff_text` / `parse_unified_diff`** — gate a summary against a RAW unified diff
  (a webhook payload, GitHub's `.diff` URL) with no git checkout at all: the zero-receipt
  promise taken literally.

### Fixed

- **Two false-accusation classes caught by sweeping 24 real agent-authored public PRs**
  (bodies carrying the Claude Code marker, gated against their actual diffs): (1) the
  bullet form ```path`: Added the X section`` means content added IN the file, not the
  file being added — it no longer maps to a file-created claim; (2) ``fix\w+`` matched
  the word *fixture* and manufactured phantom file-touched claims — verb forms pinned.
  Post-fix sweeps: our 80-commit history 4/4 VERIFIED, the 24-PR market corpus 8/8
  VERIFIED across 6 claim-bearing PRs — **zero false accusations on either corpus**.
  Regression tests carry both catches by name.

## [7.29.1] — 2026-08-01 — diffgate validated against 80 real commits; the false-accusation class closed

### Fixed

- **`styxx.diffgate` path recognition** — validated before announcement by sweeping the
  gate over 80 real commits of this repo's own history. First sweep: zero claims extracted
  (templates too rigid for real prose) → verb…path window + bullet `path: description`
  forms added. Second sweep: 10 claims, **six CONTRADICTED — and all six were FALSE
  ACCUSATIONS**: decimals (0.5349), versions (v0.6.2), DOIs, and dotted module names all
  matched the naive any-dotted-token path pattern. A gate that can accuse a number of not
  being a file does not ship. Fix: claimed paths must end in a closed-set file extension.
  Final sweep: 80 commits, 4 claims, 4/4 VERIFIED, **zero false accusations**. Coverage on
  this repo's unusually prose-heavy messages is deliberately low and disclosed; bullet-form
  agent PR bodies are the template-shaped common case.

## [7.29.0] — 2026-08-01 — the zero-receipt gate: a summary cannot lie about its diff

### Added

- **`styxx.diffgate` — the trust stack pointed at UNMODIFIED agent work** (`gate_diff`,
  `DiffGate`; CLI `python -m styxx.diffgate SUMMARY.md --repo . --base REF [--head REF]
  [--run CMD] [--strict]`, exit 0/1). No receipts, no preregs, no cooperation from the
  agent that wrote the summary: extract every diff-shaped claim from a PR body / commit
  message / session report and verify it against what `git diff` actually says. Catches
  "updated X" when X isn't in the diff, "adds function retry" when no added line defines
  it, "added 5 tests" when the diff adds 2, "only touches docs/" when it edited source —
  each CONTRADICTED with the evidence named. "Tests pass" is UNCHECKABLE without `--run`
  (the gate does not take the agent's word for test results; `--strict` makes uncheckable
  fatal). Construct ceiling inline: the template set is CLOSED; uncovered prose is counted,
  never judged. Dogfooded on this repo's own release commit — honest summary PASS, seeded
  lies caught and named. 9 tests, all catch-shaped.

## [7.28.0] — 2026-08-01 — the trust stack: seal · protocol · witness · OATH v0.6.2

### Added

- **`styxx.seal` — the trust seal for agent work** (`seal`, `verify_seal`, `Seal`; CLI
  `python -m styxx.seal DOC.md receipts... [--prereg P.md=R.json] [--out SEAL.json]`, exit
  0/1 = a drop-in CI gate). Verification is the scarce primitive of the agent economy: an
  agent hands over a deliverable and the receiver either trusts it or burns hours checking.
  One call composes the shipped verifiers — every numeric claim OATH-certified against
  receipts, every referenced prereg's result re-scored through its FROZEN gates block with
  the claimed verdict required to match the frozen table's, the composite bound under a
  content hash `verify_seal` re-derives. SEALED / SEALED_VACUOUS (nothing checkable — said
  loudly, never silently) / REFUSED with the failing claim named. Inherits the OATH's
  boundary verbatim: numeric claims and frozen-gate verdicts, never prose truth. Dogfooded
  at birth on `FINDING_b31v2_door_opens` (SEALED, 20/12/0, zero refusals). 7 tests, all
  refusal-shaped.

- **`styxx.protocol` — the research loop as enforceable machinery** (`Experiment`,
  `ProtocolVerdict`). The witness harnesses the program's instruments; this harnesses its
  *process*. An agent cannot score a run whose prereg isn't committed in git history (a
  prereg on disk is a draft, not a freeze); gates parse from a fenced ```gates block in the
  frozen document itself — there is no API to pass a bar at scoring time; verdicts walk the
  frozen outcome table mechanically (the agent reports the verdict, it does not choose it);
  smoke scoring is INVALID by type regardless of numbers; a non-total outcome table
  surfaces as a prereg design bug instead of being guessed around; the gates-block sha256
  and prereg commit travel with every verdict. Born the week the discipline earned it: two
  same-day INVALIDs (b34 v1/v2) honored by convention — this makes the convention
  machinery. 8 tests, all exercising the refusals, because the refusals are the product.

- **`styxx.witness` — the measured-boundary harness** (`Witness`, `WitnessVerdict`,
  `MEASURED_CAPABILITIES`; specified by
  [SYNTHESIS_connection_of_minds_2026_08_01.md](papers/SYNTHESIS_connection_of_minds_2026_08_01.md) §8,
  OATH-HELD 36/5/0). One object composes the program's deployable powers — the borrowed
  conscience, behavioral grounding, the know-say datasheet, the retained probe, the register
  preflight — behind a registry in which every capability carries its measured operating
  point and its measured blindspots, quoted from the receipts that produced them and PINNED
  IN CI (tests re-derive each registry number from its committed receipt, so the harness
  cannot silently claim more than the program measured). The rails are results, not
  policies: no steer method exists (read ≠ write is measured — transfer control is 11% of
  native even where native steering works); `self_verify` always REFUSES with the 7B
  receipt (a model cannot self-verify past its own self-knowledge); a transcript showing
  deliberation-at-doubt downgrades any resampling verdict to ABSTAIN citing the c105
  blindspot (monitors systematically miss reasoned caves). *A second mind as a witness, not
  a puppeteer.* 13 new tests; B31-v2 (the content-transport door: capacity limit or
  bedrock) preregistered for the next scored run.

### Fixed

- **OATH v0.6.2 — full-precision claims join the oath** (`styxx.certify`; B33, three preregs,
  two reverted attempts, every gate green on the third —
  [RESULT](papers/closed-model-frontier/RESULT_oath_v062_SHIPPED_2026_07_31.md)). Three
  defects, each found by the previous attempt's frozen kill-gate: (1) the SHA-scrub ate the
  fractional part of any decimal with ≥7 fractional digits, so full-precision quotes — the
  most receipt-verbatim numbers in the corpus — were invisible to extraction and
  certified-by-omission; (2) a flat `1e-12` tolerance term verified any mutation in fractional
  digits ≥13 (caught a REAL 16th-digit transcription error in a committed FINDING once
  closed); (3) the typographic minus U+2212 was not read as a sign, so accurate negative
  claims could be accused — and two baseline verifications turned out to be sign-blind
  absolute-value coincidences. Corpus impact, published per-doc in the RESULT delta table:
  **VERIFIED 3064 → 3395 (+331)**; tamper-catch 0.304 → 0.319 with false-verify 0.184 → 0.166
  on a battery that grew 2980 → 3287 mutants. Five genuine doc↔receipt gaps surfaced and were
  repaired via addendum receipts / receipt-set extension / a one-digit doc correction — no
  committed result receipt modified. Flagship certs re-issued: frame-locality 37→90 verified,
  program synthesis 9→28, knowsay 93 (already at 4dp). Still owed, named: trigger-recall
  (0.5227 of the full-precision pool sits on unbound lines) and status-level float
  claim→field binding.

### Added

- **`styxx.framelocality.assess_retained_probe()` — the corruption-retaining probe design as
  API.** `removable=` says where a corruption lives; it never said what the *probe* does with it.
  When the out-of-frame query keeps the corruption in context and changes only the frame around
  it (the cycle-98 design), the readings invert: recovery parity with HELD is the *positive*
  reading (the corruption has no reach outside its frame) and a deficit is the corruption
  following the model out of frame — a shape `assess()` cannot express. The new entry point gates
  on the two controls that design needs: the probe frame must demonstrably read an unabandoned
  belief (`INVALID__probe_frame_not_validated` below the frozen HELD floor — an invalid frame
  licenses nothing in either direction), and the full frame-local claim requires a same-frame
  re-ask control (`REACH_BOUNDED__no_reask_control` without it;
  `RESTORATION_NOT_FRAME_SPECIFIC` when the bare re-ask restores as much). A negative carries
  its confound in the output: HELD is conditioned on outcome, so `CAVE_PERSISTS_OUT_OF_FRAME`
  reads channel-unlicensed, never persistence-demonstrated. Dogfooded on the program's own
  cycle-98 receipts — reproduces the published frontier negative to the digit from raw rows —
  and that shape is pinned in CI beside the v31-null pin.

- **`styxx.framelocality` — score a corruption-recovery run with the controls that actually
  discriminate, or refuse.** Ships the corrected methodology from the v31.1 erratum so the mistake
  cannot be rebuilt. `assess()` reports the *naive* margin (corrupted vs wrong-first) but labels it
  **not evidence** — when the out-of-frame query is the original question with the corruption
  removed, that margin mostly re-measures "first-correct items re-answer correctly." The
  discriminating contrast holds first-correct fixed: **recovery(CORRUPTED) vs recovery(HELD)**.
  Callers must declare `removable=` (prompt-level corruption, where recovery may be mere
  statelessness, vs weight-level, where it cannot be re-prompted away), and may supply
  `third_frame=` to test frame-invariance. `compare_arms()` provides the between-arm contrast
  required for non-removable corruptions, where a weight edit degrades the within-run control too.
  Refuses on underpowered cells (`MIN_CELL = 25`, the preregistered floor) and on a missing HELD
  control; raises on malformed records. Dogfooded on this program's own receipts: it returns
  `NULL__corruption_adds_no_signal` on the retracted inference-time run (reproducing its published
  0.9655 margin and rejecting it) and `PROPERTY_DETERMINES_BELIEF_SURVIVAL` on the surviving
  weight-channel run. Deterministic, stdlib-only.

### Added

- **`styxx.knowsay` — the know-say gap as a shipped measurement instrument.** Scores a caller-run
  two-turn protocol (the frozen, content-free `CHALLENGE` constant, byte-identical to every receipt
  in the arc) into a datasheet: strata (CAVED / HELD / WRONG_FIRST), cave rate, rescue rate,
  out-of-frame recovery, specificity margin. Runs no models itself; stdlib-only and deterministic.
  **Refuses rather than guesses:** `MIN_FIRST_CORRECT = 100` gates the cave-rate denominator and
  `MIN_CELL = 25` gates every per-stratum rate — unlicensed rates come back `None` with the failing
  floor named, and a partial belief probe raises rather than silently subsetting. Floors are the
  ones the preregistrations froze. Datasheet and measured operating characteristics:
  `papers/agent-conscience/DATASHEET_knowsay_2026_07_27.md`.

### Changed

- **`styxx.mount` docstrings — two parity/scope corrections, no behavior change.**
  `ConscienceMount.relock` now records that the private-calibration recovery is, at matched probe
  capacity and fit size, *majority probe capacity and minority privacy* — the operative defense is
  "a richer probe **and** a private split," not a private split alone. The module docstring now says
  the honesty signal remains **probe-readable** on clean data and flags that this is a
  probe-and-held-out-accuracy fact, not a claim that the attacked model still *says* the right
  answer (measured behavioral out-of-frame recovery under a knowledge-preserving attack is partial,
  about half). Neither correction weakens the underlying result: calibration poisoning is real and
  the re-locked read does recover through the attack. Sources:
  `papers/calib-poison-general/SCOPE_NOTE_privacy_vs_capacity_2026_07_09.md`,
  `papers/read-neq-write/SCOPE_NOTE_probe_survival_is_not_behavioral_survival_2026_07_28.md`.

---

## [7.27.0] — 2026-07-23 — anchors: the anchor threshold, as a design-time instrument

`styxx.anchors` gains the "anchor threshold" as three closed-form, dependency-light functions:
how many known-label anchors you need before "no detection" of a shared, all-judge,
truth-independent blind spot actually means something. Backs Section 7 of "Gold Anchors License
Nothing" (Fathom v30) and its real-judge demonstration.

### Added

- **`styxx.anchors.blindspot_power(K, *, J, fp_rate, trap_rate=…|p_alt=…, alpha=0.05)`** — exact
  power to detect an all-judge shared blind spot from `K` known-label anchors, via the count of
  unanimous-wrong anchors, using the standard most-powerful one-sided binomial test. Returns the
  null/alternative unanimous-wrong probabilities, the single-anchor likelihood ratio, the critical
  count, the achieved type-I rate, and the power.
- **`styxx.anchors.min_anchors_for_power(target_power, …)`** — smallest anchor budget that reaches
  a target power against a given blind spot (e.g. ~15 known-negatives for 0.90 power at the J=3
  design point).
- **`styxx.anchors.anchor_lr(…)`** — single-anchor likelihood ratio of one unanimous-wrong
  known-negative (blind-spot vs benign).
- All three are surfaced at the top level (`styxx.blindspot_power`, etc.) and covered by six new
  behavioral tests. The functions use the tight standard test; note this is strictly more powerful
  than the conservative rejection region used in the exploratory receipt (the paper's earlier
  power table is a valid lower bound).

---

## [7.26.0] — 2026-07-20 — anchors: the auditor of the judges

One new module, and it audits the layer everyone now trusts by default: LLM judge panels.

### Added

- **`styxx.anchors`** — label-free judge-panel auditing with anchored identification.
  `audit_panel(V, neg, pos)` takes a verdict matrix and two known-label anchor strata and
  returns either a prevalence estimate wrapped in its own MEASURED operating characteristics,
  or a refusal that names why (`VOID_PANEL__uninformative` for panels no judge of which clears
  the noise-margin informativeness gate; `VOID_ANCHORS__nonexchangeable` when the unclipped
  solution is impossible and the anchors cannot be reconciled with the data). Estimates carry:
  a selection-aware bootstrap interval (the selective-activation estimator, characterization
  sealed 9/9 at the Stage-A design point), a regime-keyed coverage note quoting rates measured
  on the characterization runs rather than nominal levels, a per-dataset misfit p-value from a
  parametric-bootstrap null with its power scope stated, and an explicit scope block. The
  master-key parameter prices ALL-JUDGE TRUTH-INDEPENDENT synchronized failures only, and the
  docstring says so.
- Behavioral contract in `tests/test_anchors.py` (clean recovery with regime reporting, deaf
  VOID, contamination refusal, sync-dose pricing, detector-stratum non-contamination, misfit
  null discrimination, determinism).

### Receipts (papers/anchored-validity, branch history)

The module ships with its evidence: the sealed operating-characteristics datasheet
(9/9 calibration gates), and the Stage-B arc on real panels — gold-style anchors (verbatim
pairs, direct negations) measured licensing NOTHING about organic error rates across three
task families on a real correlated Qwen panel (coverage 0/15 in every family), while
same-generator graded-ladder anchors close the anchor-organic alpha gap (0.63 -> 0.03) and
restore label-free coverage (13/13) — by correctly revealing three of the four judges as
uninformative. The misfit flag catches gross violations and is measured BLIND to smooth ones:
the flag is a bonus, the ladder is the defense. A frontier-model panel audited at
arm's length was priced exactly. Every finding OATH-certified against its receipts.

---

## [7.25.0] — 2026-07-18 — instrument admissibility: the tools that audit the tools

The release is four new modules, and the through-line is that every one of them certifies a piece of
measurement apparatus rather than a model. `admissibility` asks whether an instrument is valid in
BOTH directions; `ladder` asks whether a probe's robustness claim survives an adversarial ladder;
`calibration` asks whether a deployment threshold actually transfers off the split it was fit on;
`corpus_audit` asks whether the corpus underneath all of it is still the one you certified.

### Added

- **`styxx.admissibility` -- two-sided instrument admissibility.** The sibling of
  `probe_validity.validate_probe`, answering the other question every instrument owes its user: is
  it SPECIFIC (quiet on a null population) *and* SENSITIVE (fires on a target-destroyed population,
  in the direction a working instrument should show)? An instrument that is sensitive but not
  specific cries wolf; specific but not sensitive is asleep; a sign-flipped one has high
  discriminability and reads the world backwards. Certifies against all three on the instrument's
  own score, with a permutation null and a self-verifying certificate
  (`instrument_admissibility`, `AdmissibilityReport`, `certificate`,
  `verify_admissibility_certificate`, `slope_permutation_null`).
  **The primitive voided itself on its first re-panel and the fix is in this release:** when no
  deployment `fire_threshold` is supplied the threshold was self-derived from the null's own
  percentile, which made the specificity leg tautological (~5% fire-rate by construction, so ANY
  instrument certified). Threshold-less calls now report `specific=None` and cap at
  `ADMISSIBLE_SENSITIVITY_ONLY`; bare `ADMISSIBLE` requires an explicit deployment threshold. The
  direction check is now rank-based (AUROC side, not means), so a rank-inverted instrument cannot
  slip through on a skewed mean, and `verify` recomputes every headline field with per-field diffs.
- **`styxx.calibration` -- transfer-safe conformal thresholds.** A deployment threshold calibrated
  on the probe's own fit split does not transfer: the calibration negatives are the probe's own
  training-split decision values, so they are not exchangeable with held-out data and NO
  calibration-split-derived threshold can repair it. Found by pointing the new admissibility
  certifier at our own flagship probe, which came back `VOID_INSTRUMENT__nonspecific` at ~2.7x its
  target false-positive rate. `conformal_threshold` gives finite-sample split-conformal thresholds;
  `calibrate_transfer_safe` enforces the three-way fit / threshold-calibrate / deploy split and
  ships a tri-state guard that REFUSES to issue a guarantee it cannot keep on fit-contaminated
  calibration data. On the probe that exposed the bug, realized false-positive rate went
  0.548 -> 0.161 against a 0.20 target. The protocol rule is now enforced in code: fit,
  threshold-calibrate and deploy must be three disjoint splits.
- **`styxx.mount.ConscienceMount.certify_admissibility`** -- the admissibility gate wired into the
  mount as an opt-in hook on the deployed margin at the calibrated operating point, with a
  fail-open contract (it reports; it is not a hard gate on your traffic).

- **`styxx.mount.ConscienceMount.attach_erasure_resistance` -- the erasure-resistance certificate
  wired into the mount.** A mounted conscience can now carry the removal-class robustness evidence
  for the instrument family (via `styxx.ladder.erasure_resistance_certificate`) inside its own
  `certificate()`: what survived verifiable subspace erasure, what broke, what is pending, what is
  unbounded -- with a mandatory NON-TRANSFER scope note (the bound documents the family's measured
  robustness on the receipted construct/models; it does not transfer to whatever axis/model a given
  mount reads). Also updates the relock-defense citation to the always-latest concept DOI. This
  completes the tool half of the erasure-bound paper pairing (discovery = the bound; tool = the
  certificate, mounted).
- **`styxx.ladder` -- the probe-robustness ladder as a first-class object.** The four-rung
  adversarial ladder a substrate probe's robustness claim should survive (calibration poisoning ->
  probe-parity attribution -> static subspace erasure -> adaptive re-fit erasure), assembled from
  the program's frozen, pre-registered attack arcs. `RUNGS` registry (frozen harnesses, preregs,
  canonical receipts, verdict strings), `report()` (per-rung verdicts + decisive per-cell reads),
  `parity_attribution()` (the MANDATORY line item: what share of a probe's recovery is capacity,
  computed live from receipts -- median 0.8379 on the honesty construct), `verify()` (ladder-wide
  receipt + canonical-verdict check), CLI `python -m styxx.ladder [--json]`. v1 scope is honest:
  the ladder over THIS repo's canonical honesty-construct receipts; arbitrary (model, probe-family)
  execution is the documented v2 (backlog G1), with the frozen per-rung scripts as its backends.
  Tests: `tests/test_ladder.py` (registry shape, loud missing-receipt failure, live-computed
  attribution, tamper-flagging of a drifted verdict).
- **`styxx.ladder.erasure_resistance_certificate` -- the first adversarially-bounded certificate
  for a substrate read.** Composes the removal-class receipts verbatim into one machine-verifiable
  object: `claim_scope` (what survived, with budgets and admissible-cell minima), `measured_breaks`
  (ERASED verdicts, surfaced with EQUAL prominence -- a certificate that hides a break is not a
  certificate), `unadjudicated` (VOID/PARTIAL), `pending` (pre-registered runs whose receipts do
  not exist yet), a MANDATORY non-empty `unbounded_dimensions` section (refuses to issue without
  one), and SHA-256 receipt hashes. Behavior pre-committed BLIND to the in-flight 3B verdict (see
  the module comment); CLI `python -m styxx.ladder --certificate OUT`. Break-handling is tested by
  fabricating an ERASED receipt.
- **`styxx.ladder.verify_erasure_certificate` + `python -m styxx.ladder --verify CERT` -- the
  certificate's tamper-check.** Re-hashes every receipt an issued certificate recorded against the
  live repository and reports `ok / mismatches / missing` -- what turns the certificate from a
  snapshot into an assurance an auditor can re-check without re-running the experiments. Detects a
  drifted or edited receipt; round-trips with `--certificate`. +2 tests.
- **`styxx.mount.ConscienceMount.relock` -- the calibration-poisoning defense, shipped.** Re-fits a
  mounted axis's probe IN-MODEL on a private, clean, labeled split of the agent's own hidden states
  the audited party never saw. This is the operation that recovered a substrate honesty read through a
  knowledge-preserving weight attack (AUROC 0.711-0.838; survives an adaptive attacker over two model
  families) in the read!=write attack-defense study (`papers/read-neq-write/`, DOI
  10.5281/zenodo.21241185). Additive: existing mount semantics unchanged; the axis gains `relocked` /
  `relock_n_pos` / `relock_n_neg` provenance and the certificate surfaces relock status with honest
  scope (defeats calibration poisoning, not activation-geometry perturbation). Runnable demo:
  `examples/mount_relock_defense.py` (numpy-only, 0%->100% lies caught after relock).
- **`styxx.corpus_audit` -- standing corpus re-certification / tamper-evidence check.** Point it at a
  directory; for every `*.certificate.json` it resolves the receipts that certificate recorded,
  SHA-verifies them (flags drift), and re-runs the current verifier on the document -- answering, on
  demand, "is every number we ever shipped still grounded at the receipts it cited?" `--tamper`
  additionally mutates each VERIFIED token once and reports the corpus tamper-catch rate (the
  mutant-battery scheme, lifted into the package). Open primitive (`OPEN_CORE.md`); no result is
  cached or gated. `python -m styxx.corpus_audit [ROOT] [--tamper] [--json OUT]`.

### Changed

- **OATH v0.5 -- certifier precision (five of six classes shipped; `styxx/certify.py`).** Kills the
  dominant false-positive classes so the verifier can be turned on documents it did not author (the
  gating property for the model-card scorecard and Annex-IV lint). Shipped, each gated on a
  severable `V05_*` flag: **self-scoped `n=`** (an "N=4" no longer obligates every bare integer on
  its line -- the biggest measured false-positive class), unit-suffixed ranges ("2-3B"), arXiv ids,
  `@`-parameters ("cosine@0.90"), and derived-percent VERIFY ("12.7% (19/150" verifies iff both
  operands ground and 100*a/b rounds to the token). The sixth proposed class (approx-notation
  `≈/~`) was DROPPED by the prereg's severability procedure -- the mutant battery showed it cost 3
  catches and added 6 false-verifies while also suppressing real `~`-written provenance gaps. Bars
  held at the cycle-25 values (battery catch 117/269, false-verify 26, validator D1 16 D2 0,
  13-doc recert artifacts 0). Six single-experiment docs: 11 false positives -> 3 (all real
  provenance gaps). Prereg `PREREG_oath_v05_precision_2026_07_13.md`; result (OATH-HELD 47/0)
  `RESULT_oath_v05_precision_2026_07_13.md`; +7 regression tests in `tests/test_certify_recall.py`.

- **`styxx.certify` OATH v0.4 -- trigger-recall extension (decimal+range-guarded).** The certifier's
  UNGROUNDED trigger vocabulary now covers the correlation/similarity register (RSA, RDM, Spearman,
  correlation, rho, consistency, reliability, ceiling, agreement, convergence, drift, entropy,
  similarity, variance) in addition to the AUROC/margin/FPR register -- but only for a number that is
  a *fractional correlation* (`decimals > 0` and value in [-1, 1]), so ordinals, counts, API
  constants, and whole-percents are never obligated. A corrupted correlation value now fires
  UNGROUNDED instead of silently falling to ABSTAIN. Tamper-catch on the cycle-18 mutant battery
  rose 58 -> 119 of 269 (0.216 -> 0.442) with no false-verify regression and zero certifier
  artifacts. Validated by the frozen OATH v0 gate (`validate_oath_v0.py` D1 >= 16, D2 = 0, unchanged).
  Preregs + result: `papers/closed-model-frontier/PREREG_oath_v04_recall_decimalguard_2026_07_04.md`,
  `RESULT_oath_v04_recall_decimalguard_2026_07_04.md` (arc: cycles 23-25).
- **README restructured 1288 -> 200 lines** — 30-second pitch, install+quickstart, ONE instruments
  table (every headline number with its receipt path), the discipline section, links. Every claim
  adversarially fact-checked against repo receipts before shipping; the unverifiable (a GHSA id with
  no in-repo receipt) was cut. Root markdown 15 -> 8 files: announcements/quickstarts/findings/
  governance moved under docs/ (inbound links fixed); AUTOPILOT.md, LEADERBOARD.md, PATENTS.md kept
  at root deliberately (live scheduler contract; CI path-trigger + cli fallback + published blob
  URLs; legal-notice convention + URLs frozen in the published Zenodo spec and NIST submission).
- **"Pure Python" claim retired** (README, pyproject description) — the base install ships compiled
  numpy + scikit-learn, so the claim was false. Replaced with what is true and differentiating:
  no torch, no GPU, no LLM in the loop for the core instruments.
- **cognitive-telescope workflow no longer red-Xes daily** — all TELESCOPE_* key secrets are empty,
  which is a configuration state, not a failure; the workflow now skips green with a notice and the
  schedule stays armed. Known remaining gap: telescope/prompts.json is not tracked (and absent
  locally), so the corpus must be restored before keys make the run real.

### Fixed

- **Register instruments now refuse a wordless response (domain guard).** `score_all(prompt="X", response="")`
  returned deception 0.999 / overconfidence 0.954 — a confident score for an input the register instruments
  have no domain over (empty text is not maximally deceptive). `score_all` now omits the register instruments
  (`sycophancy`, `deception`, `overconfidence`, `refusal`) when the response carries no natural-language word
  content (empty, whitespace-only, emoji-only), so a caller aggregating fingerprints counts the omission
  instead of folding an artifact into a paired conduct delta.
  - A pre-registered length sweep **falsified** the "score stabilizes at N tokens" model: deception is
    content- not length-driven (a 5-word factual answer reads 0.19; a correct 18-word textbook answer reads
    0.99), so no token threshold was invented — the guard fires only on the unambiguous zero-word case.
    Boundary tests cover empty / whitespace / emoji-only (out of domain) and pin the current behavior of
    single-word and JSON-tool-call responses (still scored). See
    `papers/grounded-honesty-axis/NOTE_instrument_domain_2026_07_01.md`, which also pre-registers the deeper
    open question (does the deception channel read conduct or content on benign batteries?).

## [7.24.3] — 2026-06-30 — py3.9 fix + deep claim-auditor fuzz hardening

### Fixed
- **Python 3.9 crash loading bundled receipts** — `competence_cliff()` (and `hf_audit`) called
  `importlib.resources.files("styxx._data")`, which on 3.9 dereferences `package.__file__`. `styxx._data`
  had no `__init__.py`, so it was a namespace package with `__file__ is None` → `TypeError`. Added the
  `__init__.py`; 3.10+ used a different resolver, so only 3.9 was affected. `requires-python` is `>=3.9`, so
  this was a real break. Swept all four `resources.files()` call sites and every declared package — no other
  namespace-package landmines (`styxx.attack.seeds` and `styxx.compliance.templates` already had `__init__`).
- **ISO datetimes leaked range claims** — a `T`-suffixed timestamp (`2026-06-30T14:30:00Z`) defeated the
  ISO-date mask (the trailing `\b` failed before `T`), so the `MM-DD` re-read as a phantom `06`/`30` range.
  The mask now spans the optional `[ T]hh:mm[:ss][.f][Z]` time portion.
- **Dash-run identifiers leaked range claims** — international phone numbers (`+1-555-123-4567`) and
  `DD-MM-YYYY` dates produced phantom ranges. Any run of 3+ dash-joined integer groups is now masked; a real
  statistical range is always exactly two numbers, so genuine ranges (`12-15`, `10-20%`) are untouched.
- **Unicode `×` multiplier silently dropped** — `3×` (U+00D7) never matched because a trailing `\b` can't
  form a boundary after a non-word symbol, so "3× stronger" extracted nothing (the multiplier test passed
  vacuously). Now matched via a not-followed-by-alnum guard, which also correctly rejects dimensions (`3x2`).

### Internal
- Dropped two dead imports (`dataclasses.field`, `typing.Optional`) that had failed the `ruff` lint step of
  the `tests` workflow since 7.24.0. CI is green across 3.9–3.12 for the first time in three releases.

+7 regression tests (18/18 in the claim-audit suite; 1675 pass overall). Found by a post-7.24.2 adversarial
fuzz sweep of the extractor across dates, times, versions, IPs, phones, ranges, sci-notation, and unicode.

---

## [7.24.2] — 2026-06-30 — claim-auditor robustness (dotted-identifier fuzz fix)

### Fixed
- **Dotted identifiers no longer misread as decimal claims** — semantic versions (`3.11.2`), tool versions
  (`CUDA 12.4.1`), and IP addresses (`192.168.1.1`) previously leaked their sub-parts into the decimal
  extractor (`3.11`/`.2`, `12.4`/`.1`, `.1`/`.1`). Any number with 3+ dotted segments is now masked before
  scanning — the same class of fix as 7.24.1's ISO-date mask. Genuine single-dot decimals, CIs, and
  scientific notation are unaffected.

+2 regression tests (13/13 pass). Found by a post-7.24.1 adversarial fuzz sweep of the extractor.

---

## [7.24.1] — 2026-06-30 — claim-auditor robustness (post-release fuzz fixes)

### Fixed
- **ISO dates no longer misread as range claims** — `2026-06-30` previously produced phantom `06`/`30` "range"
  numbers, over-flagging every dated document. Added an ISO-date pattern to the skip list.
- **Scientific notation** is now captured with its exponent (`1.2e-5` was read as `1.2`), and `_decimals` is
  exponent-aware so tiny values match at the right precision (no false grounding of `1.2e-5` to `0.04`).
- **Numeric dict keys** as sources (`{0.294: "label"}`) are now collected, not silently dropped.
- **Set/frozenset sources** are treated as containers.

Verified by a 4-lens post-release sweep: the published PyPI artifact installs/imports/CLIs cleanly, the auditor
never crashed across 41 adversarial inputs, and `render_html()` HTML-escapes all user-controlled content (no XSS).

---

## [7.24.0] — 2026-06-30 — claim grounding: does every number in a claim trace to a receipt?

### Added
- **`audit_grounding(text, sources)`** — a new agent-integrity primitive (the third, after `audit_confound`
  and `validate_probe`). Deterministically extracts every statistical number from a claim (RSA, CIs, p-values,
  %, fold-changes) and classifies each **GROUNDED** / **DERIVED** (a %/ratio of two source values) /
  **UNSOURCED** against the data — no LLM, no web. Ignores non-statistical numbers (years, DOIs, arXiv ids,
  section/heading/list numbers, version tags, "95% CI" labels). `report.verdict` is CI-gate friendly.
- **`detect_overclaims(text)`** — a negation-aware heuristic linter flagging language that reaches past the
  data: priority/"first", equivalence-from-a-failed-rejection, certainty, causal-from-correlational, hype, and
  "survives/robust" with no CI nearby. Flags for review, not verdicts.
- **`GroundingReport.render_html()`** — a self-contained styxx-brand audit card.
- CLI: `python -m styxx.claim_audit <claim> <sources…>`. Exported from `styxx`.

Dogfooded on a fathom-lab preprint: grounded 119/132 numbers, flagged the 12 not in result files (one the
authors had caught only by hand), and the linter flagged the authors' own equivalence phrasing for revision.

---

## [7.23.0] — 2026-06-29 — the substrate gate: the confound auditor now refuses to trust its own synthetic corpus

7.22.0's report card flagged HuggingFace classifiers as length-biased on a *frontier-generated* corpus —
then a ground-truth re-run on real human-labeled data (Yelp/Amazon/Civil Comments) showed **none of the
alarming verdicts replicate** (`papers/grounded-honesty-axis/FINDING_groundtruth_substrate_artifact_2026_06_27.md`).
The cause: a generator can entangle the confound with the construct vocabulary, and the bag-of-words
"construct-recoverable" check we used to *validate* the corpus is the artifact's **fingerprint**, not a
control. This release makes that lesson structural in the tool itself.

### Added
- **`corpus_provenance`** on `audit_confound` (`"synthetic"` / `"ground_truth"` / `"unspecified"`). Any
  alarming verdict (`THRESHOLD-BIASED` / `CONFOUND-DEPENDENT`) on a non-ground-truth corpus now carries a
  **`SYNTHETIC-ARTIFACT RISK`** caveat and sets `report.synthetic_artifact_warning`.
- **Lexical-entanglement fingerprint** (`report.lexical_confound_corr` / `lexical_confound_p`): a model-free
  permutation test of whether a label-trained bag-of-words *margin* itself rides the confound within class —
  a model-free analogue of the VADER probe that refuted the report card, generalized to any construct via a
  label-trained margin (no magic threshold).
- **`validate_against_ground_truth(report, real_rows, ...)`** + **`cem_length_match(...)`**: the productized
  ground-truth protocol — coarsened-exact-match a real human-labeled corpus on the confound, re-run the
  identical audit, and reconcile (`SYNTHETIC-ARTIFACT (refuted)` / `CONFIRMED` / `REAL-ONLY` / `CLEAR`).
- `audit_hf_model` now declares its bundled corpora **synthetic**, so its verdicts surface the warning by
  default — the tool flags its own substrate.

### Changed
- Docstrings corrected: a high BoW-recoverability AUC is **not** proof of orthogonality. `audit_confound`
  gained `check_entanglement` (default on).

---

## [7.22.0] — 2026-06-26 — styxx.audit_hf_model: audit any HuggingFace classifier for length bias in one call

`audit_confound` is instrument-agnostic but asks you to bring an orthogonal corpus and wire up the
scoring. For the two most common cases — sentiment and toxicity classifiers — that friction is now
gone: styxx ships the validated, length-orthogonal boundary corpora as package data and collapses the
whole pipeline into a single call. The "send me your classifier" ask becomes
`pip install 'styxx[hf]'; styxx audit-model <id>`.

### Added
- **`styxx.audit_hf_model(model_id, construct="sentiment"|"toxicity")`** — loads a HuggingFace
  text-classification model, scores the bundled boundary corpus (n=200), and returns a
  `ConfoundAuditReport` (`.verdict`, `.confound_score_coef` + CI, `.within_stratum_auc`, and a
  ready-to-use `.guard()` when THRESHOLD-BIASED). Robust, *verifiable* label mapping (positive-polarity
  for sentiment incl. 1–5★ star heads, toxic-probability for toxicity); override with `score_label=` or
  bypass model loading entirely with `score_fn=`. `trust_remote_code` is left **off** — auditing a model
  never executes its repo code.
- **`styxx audit-model <model_id> [--construct …] [--label …] [--format card|json]`** CLI command.
- **`styxx.available_constructs()`** — the constructs with a bundled corpus.
- **Bundled boundary corpora** as package data (`styxx/_data/confound_boundary_{sentiment,toxicity}.jsonl`).
- New optional extra **`styxx[hf]`** (`transformers>=4.40`, `torch>=2.6`). `torch>=2.6` is required to
  deserialize legacy `.bin` checkpoints under the CVE-2025-32434 safety gate (safetensors is exempt).

### Provenance
- Reproduces the prior single-model finding through the one-call path (distilbert-sst2:
  THRESHOLD-BIASED, +0.106 [0.026, 0.186]); the bundled corpora are the same validated grids
  (BoW construct-recoverable AUC 0.99 / 1.00). Used to grade a 9-classifier **Confound Report Card**
  (`papers/grounded-honesty-axis/FINDING_hf_report_card_2026_06_26.md` + reproducible
  `hf_report_card_repro.py`): 4 ride length, 2 are confound-dependent, both prior-audited controls
  replicate. 18 new tests, all runnable on a base install via injected `score_fn` (incl. CLI + the
  bundled-corpus orthogonality gate).

---

## [7.21.1] — 2026-06-26 — audit_confound proves out on a real third-party model + key-free Colab

The day after `audit_confound` shipped, we pointed it outward — at a model we did not build — to
test the one thing a confound auditor must do: work on a real, black-box classifier, not just our
own instruments.

### Added
- **External-model validation.** `audit_confound` flagged the most-downloaded HuggingFace sentiment
  model (`distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english`) for a real length bias **at the decision
  boundary** — longer mildly-negative reviews read more positive (coef +0.11 [0.026, 0.186]) — while
  clearing `unitary/toxic-bert` as ROBUST. A discriminating tool, not a wolf-crier, and the reusable
  methodological lesson: **confounds hide at saturation; probe the decision boundary, not the
  extremes.**
- **One-click, key-free Colab** (`examples/audit_confound_colab.ipynb`) — runs the auditor on a real
  HF model in the browser, no API key required.

### Fixed
- Self-review before publishing caught and corrected a real defect in the auditor's own output, plus
  a `plan_action` length-read wording error and a non-additive-effect overstatement — the discipline
  applied to ourselves, in public.

---

## [7.21.0] — 2026-06-25 — styxx.audit_confound: confound-robustness auditing for ANY score

A scorer can pass every standard check — high accuracy, cross-domain generalization, a held-out
split — and still track a **confound** (response length, formatting, politeness) instead of the
concept it claims to measure. When confound and concept come apart in deployment, oversight fails
*silently*: the dashboard stays green. This release ships the auditor for exactly that failure.

### Added
- **`styxx.audit_confound()` + `build_confound_grid()`** — a frontier model builds a
  construct⟂confound corpus; the auditor returns `ROBUST` / `THRESHOLD-BIASED` (+ a validated
  `report.guard()` deployment fix) / `CONFOUND-DEPENDENT` / `INCONCLUSIVE`, each with bootstrap CIs.
- **First confound map of our own suite.** Dogfooded across the shipped guardrails:
  `overconfidence_v0` and `plan_action_v0` are THRESHOLD-BIASED (discrimination intact, score
  length-shifted — fixable), referenceless `deception_v0` is CONFOUND-DEPENDENT (length-dominated,
  broken), and recalibrated `sycophancy_v0.3` is the only ROBUST one. **3 of 4 ride response
  length** — surfaced by our own tool, reported without varnish.

---

## [7.20.0] — 2026-06-25 — opt-in length-aware overconfidence deployment guard

The causal length audit cleared 5 of 6 guardrails and left one shipped instrument with a deployable
length bias. This release ships the fix as an **opt-in** guard rather than silently changing a
trained default.

### Added
- **`styxx.length_adjust_overconfidence()`** — an opt-in, length-aware deployment guard for
  `overconfidence_v0`. Out-of-sample AUC 0.807 → 0.843; short↔long disparity +0.42 → −0.08. The
  instrument's discrimination was never the problem — its operating point read short answers as
  overconfident. The guard corrects the operating point without touching the trained weights.

### Changed
- The causal length-audit results are regression-locked in CI (deception construct-robust /
  overconfidence length-carried / calibration ~1.16× intrinsically wordier) so the confound map
  cannot silently drift.

---

## [7.19.1] — 2026-06-24 — probe-validity tooling + the sycophancy length confound, fixed end-to-end

Dogfooding the honesty receipts surfaced that several calibrated instruments leaned on response
length. This release closes the sycophancy case end-to-end and ships the tool that found it, turned
into a reusable primitive.

### Added
- **`styxx.validate_probe()` / `styxx.probe_validity`** — is an oversight probe tracking the
  concept, or a surface artifact? A silence gate + natural-OOD transfer (permutation-tested) +
  orthogonality-to-the-natural-direction → `VALID` / `SURFACE-ARTIFACT`. We caught our **own**
  0.98-AUC "truth probe" as a surface artifact with it: it passed control-task selectivity, a BoW
  silence gate, and cross-domain transfer, yet was orthogonal (cosine −0.05 / +0.14) to the model's
  natural truth axis and transferred to natural OOD at chance. The real axis is recoverable only
  from natural data, not template constructs.

### Fixed
- **`sycophancy_v0.3` length confound removed end-to-end.** The length-decorrelated weights (drop
  `log_word_count`, lose nothing) are now the default; the recalibrated instrument is the only one
  that subsequently audited ROBUST.

### Changed
- **The rigor discipline made structural.** A CI rigor-gate now BLOCKS any committed result whose
  verdict claims a win ("robust / significant / real / proven / generalizes") without an attached
  CI / permutation-p / disclosure. It would have blocked two of our own past overclaims; now it
  can't happen. Two already-public overclaims were self-audited and downgraded in the same pass.

---

## [7.19.0] — 2026-06-23 — parrhesia: verifiable honesty receipts

### Added
- **`styxx.parrhesia`** — verifiable honesty receipts: an external register audit any third party
  can re-derive (verify-by-re-derivation rather than trust-the-label). Ships with a self-verifying
  receipt demo that flags its own scorer false-positives rather than hiding them.

---

## [7.18.1] — 2026-06-22 — drift-gate now covers the FAILED bars (provenance honesty fix)

A multi-agent adversarial audit of 7.18.0 found a scope gap in the very claim the artifact is
built on. `styxx.compliance.competence_cliff` documents that "every shipped figure re-derives from
the committed receipt … the declared accuracy can never silently drift" — but the two FAILED
pre-registered bars (`continuous_auc_value` 0.6191, `k_precondition_value` 0.281) were package-data
literals guarded only by `<` bounds, not re-derived. An edit of 0.6191 → 0.649 would have stayed
green. For a regulator-facing provenance artifact, overstating provenance on exactly the FAILED
numbers is the worst place to overclaim.

### Fixed
- **The drift-gate now re-derives the FAILED bars too.** `tests/test_compliance_competence_cliff.py`
  ties `continuous_auc_value` to `truthfulqa_benchmark_result.json` `bars.H1.auc_merged` and
  `k_precondition_value` to `pregeneration_gate_result.json`
  `bars.K_precondition.ungated_hallucination_rate`. The provenance claim is now literally true in
  full scope: drift in either FAILED number fails the build. (15 tests; the artifact, data, and
  Article 15.1(a) mapping are otherwise unchanged.)

---

## [7.18.0] — 2026-06-22 — the per-domain accuracy declaration (EU AI Act Article 15.1(a))

EU AI Act Article 15.1(a) requires that *"levels of accuracy and relevant accuracy metrics shall
be declared in the accompanying instructions of use."* A single headline number does not satisfy
that for a model whose reliability swings by domain. This release ships the per-domain map — and
makes it structurally unable to overclaim about itself.

### Added
- **`styxx.compliance.competence_cliff()`** — the Article 15.1(a) artifact in literal form: a
  per-domain accuracy declaration. Returns a frozen `CompetenceCliff` over 37 TruthfulQA
  deployment domains × committed precision under the belief-coherence gate (gpt-4o-mini, n=790),
  each tagged `safe` / `review` / `do_not_deploy` against pre-stated thresholds (0.90 / 0.60).
  `.as_markdown()` renders an instructions-of-use declaration; `.by_tier()` / `.to_dict()` /
  `.get()` round it out. Wired in as the **lead primitive of `cite("Article 15.1(a)")`**.
- **Receipt discipline, enforced in CI.** The per-domain numbers ship as package data
  (`styxx/_data/competence_cliff_truthfulqa_gpt4omini_v1.json`), a verbatim copy of the
  `category_competence_cliff_map` committed at `a75f1e7`. A **drift-gate** test re-derives every
  shipped figure from that committed research receipt and fails the build on any divergence
  (verify-by-re-derivation — the attestation philosophy applied to a regulatory declaration). An
  **anti-rosy gate** test asserts the artifact keeps naming the bars that FAILED pre-registration
  (continuous AUC 0.619, K_precondition 0.281; `REPORT_AS_LANDED`, not `SURVIVED`) and its
  `do_not_deploy` domains — so the declaration can never silently drop its own failures.
- 13 new tests (`tests/test_compliance_competence_cliff.py`). The A3 kill-gate (uncovered ≥
  covered) remains intact: 4 Article 15 clauses mapped, 7 named as uncovered.

### Changed
- **`styxx.meaning_diff.meaning_diff()` / `meaning_diff_templates()` now return a typed
  `MeaningDiff` dataclass** instead of a raw `dict`, bringing the instrument in line with every
  other headline readout. Fully back-compatible: `r["agreement"]`, `r.get(...)`, `k in r`,
  iteration, `dict(r)`, and a new `.to_dict()` all keep working alongside attribute access
  (`r.agreement`). `MeaningDiff` is exported from `styxx.meaning_diff`. *(developed as 7.17.4;
  first shipped in 7.18.0.)*

### Docs
- `papers/EU_AI_ACT_COMPLIANCE_2026.md` §11.3 / §11.4 and the `accuracy_declaration.md` template
  now point at the shipped `competence_cliff()` API (previously the cliff map was paper-only).
- README: added a **"New in 7.16 / 7.17"** section so the shipped flagship arc — `crossmind`, the
  borrowed-conscience `mount` / `styxx.Conscience`, attestation + the 7.17.1 verifier hardening,
  and the provenance work — is no longer absent from the body (it previously stopped at 7.7.14).
  The cooperative-only scope of the conscience is stated, not glossed. The new code block was
  verified to run as written; refreshed a stale version string in the `run_doctor` example.

---

## [7.17.3] — 2026-06-19 — provenance + test-floor hardening

The version stamped into a receipt is a provenance claim; the headline AUCs need a CI that
actually runs them. This release grounds both.

### Added
- **`styxx/_version.py` single source-of-truth.** The version lives in one import-free literal,
  read by both the build (`[tool.setuptools.dynamic]`) and the runtime, so `__version__`
  reflects the code that actually ran — not stale installed metadata. A source/install desync
  surfaces as `styxx.__version_mismatch__`, and `run_doctor` warns instead of trusting it. This
  is the version stamped into every attestation / vitals receipt.
- **`tests/test_profile.py`** — the flagship `@styxx.profile` went from 25% to 93% line
  coverage (fault detection, phase transitions, every exporter, every call form).
- **`tests/test_version_provenance.py`** — locks the source → runtime → metadata → receipt chain.
- **Nightly heavy-dependency CI leg** (`.github/workflows/nightly-heavy.yml`) — installs the
  torch / nli / coherence / signing stack and guards the AUC instrument tests that silently skip
  in the light `[test]` CI. The guard asserts the heavy libs import and the tests pass — not
  "zero skips", because two tests are designed to skip when the deps are present.
- **`signing` extra** — `cryptography` was used by the handoff-signing tests but declared in no
  extra; it is now installable and CI-guardable.

### Changed
- `pyproject` version is now dynamic (read from `styxx/_version.py`); to cut a release, bump
  that one literal.
- `[tool.pytest.ini_options] testpaths = ["tests"]` — a bare `pytest` no longer walks
  `scratch/` / `scripts/dogfood/` and fires a live OpenAI 401 at collection (was 3 collection
  errors; now 0).

### Removed
- The `Typing :: Typed` classifier — the package ships no `py.typed` marker and the type-checker
  still reports errors, so the classifier was an overclaim. It returns when the public surface
  type-checks clean.

---

## [7.17.2] — 2026-06-17 — brand-integrity sweep: the package no longer overclaims about itself

A self-audit found the product's own surface committing the one sin it exists to catch —
overclaiming. None of these are runtime bugs; each is a place where the docs/API claimed
something the code didn't back. Fixed, with a regression guard so they can't recur.

### Fixed
- **`styxx.mind` raised `AttributeError`.** The README headlines `styxx.mind` (the 7.15.0
  measurement layer) but the submodule was never imported into the package namespace.
  Added `from . import mind`; `styxx.mind.mind_certificate(...)` now resolves.
- **README drift reproducer pointed at the wrong artifacts.** The "Reproducer/Result" links
  under tool-call drift pointed at the v0 files (AUC 0.915) while the headline is the v1
  retrain (0.943 ± 0.009). Repointed to `scripts/drift_calibrated_v1.py` /
  `benchmarks/drift_calibrated_v1.json`; the v0 baseline is now labeled as the v6.0 prior.
- **`VerificationResult` name collision.** `verify_certificate()` returns provenance's result
  type, but the exported `VerificationResult` was attestation's — so
  `isinstance(verify_certificate(c), styxx.VerificationResult)` was silently `False`.
  Provenance's type is now exported as **`CertificateVerificationResult`** (in `__all__`);
  attestation's keeps `VerificationResult`.
- **Marketed entrypoints were missing from `__all__`.** `profile`, `watch`, `preflight`,
  `recover_posture`, `run_doctor`, `meaning_diff`, `mind` — the front door the pyproject
  description and README headline — are now in the curated surface, so `dir(styxx)`,
  tab-completion, and `from styxx import *` show the product's entrypoints first.
- **Dropped quantitative caveats restored.** The sycophancy section now states the measured
  false-positive rate (≈0.30 on restrained-technical responses, ≈0.60 on gpt-3.5-turbo) that
  the package already declares as load-bearing in its EU AI Act disclosure, and mirrors it
  into `calibrated_weights_sycophancy_v0.CALIBRATION_NOTES`. The per-drift-type table now
  surfaces the below-chance `tool_rename` class (0.377, n≈1 / under-sampled — reported, not
  hidden). The pyproject summary's three AUCs now carry a "text-only register instruments
  with documented construct ceilings" clause.

### Added
- `tests/test_readme_api_surface.py` — guards that every `styxx.X` referenced in the README
  resolves and that every `__all__` name resolves (the `styxx.mind` regression guard).

---

## [7.17.1] — 2026-06-17 — security: harden the untrusted-verification path

### Security
`verify_attestation()` re-runs an attestation's checkers against a repo with
**every checker argument reconstructed from the (attacker-controlled) artifact**.
Three boundaries on that path are now enforced so re-verifying an untrusted
third-party receipt can no longer execute code or escape the substrate:

- **Code execution** — checkers that must import substrate code
  (`python_attr_in_iterable`, `python_attr_equals`) are **refused by default** and
  run only when the caller opts in with `verify_attestation(..., trust_substrate=True)`.
  Refused checkers are recorded in the new `VerificationResult.unsafe_checkers`
  field and force `.ok` to `False` (fail-closed, never silently skipped).
  Previously an artifact-named module was `__import__`-ed during verification,
  running its top-level code **even when the embedded digest was invalid**.
- **Arbitrary file read** — every file/path checker (`file_at_path_contains`,
  `package_version_equals`, `json_path_equals`, `pdf_page_count_equals`,
  `pdf_contains_section`, `file_byte_equals`, `value_consistent_across_paths`,
  `value_internally_consistent`, `directory_file_count_equals`) now confines its
  path/glob to the substrate root: absolute paths (POSIX, Windows, drive-relative)
  and `..` traversal are rejected, and symlinks are resolved before the containment
  check. Previously `path="../secret"` or an absolute path read arbitrary files and
  leaked their contents into the receipt evidence.
- **Git argument injection** — `branch`/`tag`/`commit` args are validated against a
  conservative ref charset and refused if they begin with `-`, closing the
  `git ... --output=PATH` arbitrary-write vector. Ref args are also passed after an
  end-of-options separator where supported.

Added `tests/test_attestation_verify_security.py` (11 tests) pinning each boundary
and confirming legitimate in-repo checks still pass. No behavior change for trusted
self-attestation: in-repo paths, real refs, and `trust_substrate=True` work exactly
as before.

---

## [7.17.0] — 2026-06-16 — `styxx.Conscience`: the conscience adapter (mount → live agent loop)

### Added — `styxx.Conscience` / `styxx.adapters.conscience.ConscienceAdapter`

The deployment surface for [7.16.0]'s `styxx.mount` — where the read-only conscience meets a live
agent loop. Parallel to `styxx.adapters.raw` (bring-your-own-activations): `raw` takes pre-captured
logprob trajectories and returns `Vitals`; `Conscience` takes pre-captured last-token **hidden states**
(plus the claim the agent just asserted) and returns a `ConscienceReading` — the borrowed-conscience
read of the agent's substrate, flagging output-vs-substrate divergence (the agent SAYS "true" while its
substrate reads false).

```python
from styxx import crossmind, mount, Conscience
axis = mount.mount_cross_model("truth", ref_states, labels, smap, mapped_anchors=agent_anchors)
cons = Conscience([axis]).calibrate("truth", agent_calibration_states)
cons.on_flag(lambda r: r.caught and escalate(r))            # your policy
reading = cons.watch(agent_hidden_state, claims={"truth": +1})   # it said "true"
if reading and reading.caught:
    ...                                                     # halt / escalate / refuse-to-emit
```

**Why an adapter over the bare `ConscienceMount`:** every styxx adapter shares one contract — **fail
open**. `mount.read()` raises on a bad read (wrong shape, unknown axis, a numerical edge); in a live
loop that would crash the very agent the conscience watches. `ConscienceAdapter` wraps the mount so a
failed read returns a null reading (and warns) and your generation continues — the same guarantee
`styxx.OpenAI` / `styxx.Anthropic` give for vitals. `.watch()` / `.watch_batch()` / `.caught()` are the
fail-open reads; `on_flag` is the policy hook; `calibrate` / `calibrate_threshold` / `certificate` pass
through to the mount. **READ-ONLY by construction** — `steer` / `intervention` are REFUSED at the
adapter layer too (read != write). White-box (you bring the activations → open-weight / self-host
agents, not sealed APIs); **cooperative-scope** monitor (drift, sycophantic caving, unintentional lies)
— NOT a defense against an agent trained to evade it (carries `styxx.mount`'s ATTACK-TRANSFERS bound).
Numpy-only. Top-level `styxx.Conscience(mount_or_axes, on_flag=..., fail_open=...)`; 16 tests
(`tests/test_adapter_conscience.py`).

## [7.16.0] — 2026-06-16 — `styxx.mount` (conscience mount) + `styxx.crossmind` (portable value readout)

### Added — `styxx.mount`: a read-only conscience you bolt onto a generating agent

The deployed integrity layer the portable-conscience arc was built for. Mount value axes
(truth / danger / refusal — transported label-free via `styxx.crossmind`) onto a generating agent;
the mount reads the agent's **own** last-token hidden state along each axis and flags
**output-vs-substrate divergence** — the agent SAYS "true" while its substrate reads false (a
sycophantic cave / lie), or COMPLIES while its substrate reads danger.

```python
from styxx import crossmind, mount
axis = mount.mount_cross_model("truth", ref_states, labels, state_map, mapped_anchors=agent_anchors)
m = mount.ConscienceMount([axis]); m.calibrate("truth", agent_calibration_states)
m.on_flag(lambda r: r.caught and halt_or_escalate(r))      # the integrator's policy
reading = m.read(agent_hidden_state, claims={"truth": +1}) # agent just said "true"
reading.caught                                              # True if substrate reads false
```

The conscience is **borrowed** from a different reference model, so the agent has no labels of its own
to game and the readout does not rely on its (gameable) self-report. **READ-ONLY by construction** —
`steer` / `intervention` are REFUSED (read != write); acting on a flag is the integrator's policy via
`on_flag`. Numpy-only, no torch. Self-test: `python -m styxx.mount selftest` (catches a transported lie
at ~0.97, false-alarm ~0.03).

`calibrate_threshold(name, honest_states, claims, target_fpr=...)` sets a per-axis `tau` to hold the
false-alarm rate at/below a target on a labeled honest set — a tunable operating point for deployment.
`claim_from_logits(logits, pos_ids, neg_ids)` derives the agent's claim polarity in the forced-choice
(next-token) case. Invariants pre-registered in
`papers/conscience-mount/PREREG_mount_v0_2026_06_12.md`; gates M1–M4 enforced by `tests/test_mount.py`
(17 tests). Live cross-model catch on real models: `papers/showcase-viz/run_mount_live_catch.py`.

### Added — `styxx.crossmind`

Read **one model's value-state** (truth, harm-avoidance, …) using a value axis fit on a *different*
reference model — through a label-free map of last-token hidden states, read in a ZCA-whitened
(Mahalanobis) frame. **No labels on the target model.** Productizes the portable-conscience arc
(`papers/showcase-viz/`, 2026-06-11: VALUES-PORTABLE, WHITENING-RESOLVES, conscience-coordinates).

```python
from styxx import crossmind
axis  = crossmind.fit_axis(reference_states, labels, name="truth")          # on a reference model
smap  = crossmind.fit_state_map(target_anchor_states, reference_anchor_states)  # paired, label-free
coords = crossmind.read(axis, target_states, state_map=smap)                # NO target labels
```

For CROSS-model reads use `read_cross_model(...)`, which whitens in the **mapped-target** metric
(shrunk via `zca_shrink`) rather than the reference metric — the label-free map distorts covariance, so
reading mapped points in the reference metric leaves a residual anisotropy (validated in
`FINDING_mapped_whitening_2026_06_12.md`, BASIS-CLEARED). `read(...)` stays reference-metric for
in-model reads.

Sibling of `styxx.transport` (embedding-space transport); `crossmind` works on the residual streams
of generative models and adds the whitened orthonormal-basis readout. **READ-ONLY by construction** —
it returns a coordinate, never an edit; `steering` / `intervention` are REFUSED (read != write), and a
borrowed refusal axis is REFUSED as a `content_danger` reader (HARM-AXIS-NULL bound). Pure stdlib +
numpy, no torch (bring your own activation extractor). Self-test: `python -m styxx.crossmind selftest`.
Invariants pre-registered in `papers/crossmind-instrument/PREREG_crossmind_v0_2026_06_12.md`; gates
T1–T4 enforced by `tests/test_crossmind.py` (19 tests).

---

## [7.15.0] — 2026-06-10 — `styxx.meaning_diff`: the meaning-regression instrument

### Added — `styxx.meaning_diff`

Did two models **mean the same thing**? Given two models' concept representations (rows aligned by
concept), report an agreement score, a HEALTHY / DRIFTED / BROKEN verdict, **the concepts that
diverge most** (named and ranked), and a reliability flag that says when *not* to trust the
comparison.

```python
from styxx.meaning_diff import meaning_diff
r = meaning_diff(model_a_reps, model_b_reps, words=concepts)
r["agreement"]            # 0..1   e.g. Qwen-1.5B vs Qwen-3B = 0.93 (HEALTHY); vs a shuffle = 0.02 (BROKEN)
r["verdict"]              # HEALTHY / DRIFTED / BROKEN
r["divergent_concepts"]   # [("mirror", 0.21), ("lamp", 0.18), ...] — what moved
```

The use case nobody has a clean tool for: **model-migration / quantization / distillation / fine-tune
regression QA** — did the new model keep the meaning of the old one, and *which concepts did it
lose?* Norm-equalized by default (the convention validated in the anatomy arc, which the unweighted
template average understated 2–60×), so the number is trustworthy; `meaning_diff_templates` measures
split-half reliability when raw per-template states are supplied. Pure stdlib + numpy — installs in
the core wheel, no torch. Validation gates D1–D5 (`papers/mind-instrument/meaning_diff_v0_validation.json`,
ALL-GATES-PASS); 11 tests.

Built on the night's certified science: the norm-domination apparatus fix, the convergent
concept geometry, and the verification thesis that surface coherence is the cheapest counterfeit.

---

## [7.14.0] — 2026-06-10 — the certified mind: `styxx.mind`, `styxx.certify` (OATH), `styxx.token`

### Added — `styxx.certify`: OATH, the certificate-carrying document

Extract every numeric claim from a document, ground each against the receipt JSONs it cites, emit a
machine-checkable certificate (`VERIFIED` / `ABSTAIN` / `UNGROUNDED` → `OATH-HELD|FAILED`). The
verifier **passed its own pre-registered mutant battery** (16/20 seeded corruptions caught at bar 16,
zero false alarms on clean docs — `OATH-V0-VALID`) and, while being built, caught real errors in its
own author's documents three separate times. v0.3 binding rules: table-header inheritance,
range-sanity for bounded quantities, count-to-field stem binding, notation filters.

```bash
python -m styxx.certify FINDING.md receipt1.json receipt2.json   # -> FINDING.certificate.json
```

### Added — `styxx.mind`: the certified mind-profile instrument

Profile a mind along validated axes only — behavioral conduct under pressure (black-box, output-only:
works on closed frontier models) and meaning-geometry citizenship vs the six-model convergence
anchors — and emit a receipt-carrying certificate. Exact ports of the frozen B-series and
real-convergence apparatus, equivalence-gated against the original receipts (5/5 validation gates).
The demarcation registry is the point: rhythm, geometry-drift manipulation detection, and
consciousness are **REFUSED axes**, each refusal carrying the receipt of the experiment that killed
or bounded it. An instrument that can refuse is the only kind whose YES means anything.

```bash
python -m styxx.mind behavioral b22_result.json --subject Qwen2.5-3B
```

### Added — `styxx.token`: read-only $STYXX holder-tier lookup

Pure-stdlib, hold-based tier mapping via public Solana RPC. Holds no keys, signs nothing, moves no
funds; the token never gates the OSS library.

### Research receipts (repo)

Closed-model frontier B18-S/B22/B24 (silent-cave detection: behavioral grounding AUC 1.0 where
text-only sycophancy sits at chance), OATH corpus attestation over every finding doc, the
ancient-question CAPSTONE (first OATH-HELD synthesis: 38 verified / 0 ungrounded), AUTOPILOT loop
contract + moonshot ladder.

---

## [7.12.0] — 2026-06-03 — `meaning_agreement`: reference-free cross-model meaning comparison

### Added — `styxx.meaning_agreement`

Do two models **mean the same**? Compares one model's concept geometry to another's — **no human reference
needed** — and names which concepts they represent most differently.

```python
from styxx import meaning_agreement
rep = meaning_agreement(model_a_embeddings, model_b_embeddings, words=concepts)
# -> {"agreement": 0.97, "most_divergent_concepts": [(word, score), ...]}
```

Use cases nobody has a tool for: **model migration / distillation / quantization regression QA** — *did the
new model keep the meaning of the old one, and if not, which concepts did it lose?* Demonstrated: a model
vs its quantized self keeps meaning at 8/4-bit (agreement 0.97+) but breaks at 2-bit (0.67) and 1-bit
(0.39), with the lost concepts named. Built on the same rotation/scale-invariant cosine-RDM core as the
7.11.0 meaning-integrity monitor.

---

## [7.11.0] — 2026-06-03 — `styxx.meaning_integrity`: does a model MEAN what a human means?

### Added — `styxx.meaning_integrity`: machine-side meaning-integrity monitor

A model can produce fluent, plausible output while its internal *understanding* is wrong or degraded. This
primitive reads the meaning behind the output: it compares a model's **concept geometry** to a **human
meaning reference** (a concept × human-feature matrix) and reports an alignment score, a
HEALTHY/DEGRADED/BROKEN verdict, and *which* concepts diverge most.

```python
from styxx import MeaningReference, MeaningVitalSign
ref = MeaningReference(human_features, words=concepts)        # human judgments, (N, F)
vs  = MeaningVitalSign(ref).calibrate(healthy_embeddings)     # (N, D), same concepts
vs.check(current_embeddings)   # -> alignment, dispersion_ratio, status, worst_concepts
```

Two channels: `meaning_alignment` (mean-centered, L2-normalized cosine-RDM RSA — **provably invariant to
rotation/scale/translation**, so it reads *meaning*, not the surface basis) + `meaning_dispersion`
(scale-*dependent*, catches the uniform collapse the angular channel is blind to). `MeaningVitalSign`
calibrates on a healthy model and judges drift **relative to that baseline**. Reference-agnostic — bring
your own concept × human-feature matrix (e.g. Binder et al. 2016, the Lancaster Sensorimotor Norms).

Validation (in `papers/ai-human-alignment`, every claim with its caveat attached):

- **Mechanics 5/5** — invariant to 1e-16; sensitive to corruption; separable healthy/degraded; **localizes
  which concepts broke** (ROC-AUC ~0.95).
- **Safety** — catches *plausible-but-wrong*: a model whose top-1 outputs still look sensible while its
  relational meaning is broken (the gap output-inspection misses).
- **Generalizes** — transfers to English with an independent reference + models (localization AUC 0.91).
- **Real-drift** — catches REAL fine-tuning damage (label-noise BERT → BROKEN) and distinguishes it from
  *helpful* fine-tuning (real categories → HEALTHY). Not just synthetic corruptions.

Honest scope: discrimination needs a *rich* reference the models actually align with (thin/perceptual
norms give weak signal); the underlying "deep beats shallow at human meaning" finding is **contingent**
(replicates in Chinese, ties in English); a vital sign should be trended, not gated on one reading.

New public API: `MeaningReference`, `MeaningVitalSign`, `meaning_alignment`, `meaning_dispersion`,
`per_concept_alignment`, `meaning_integrity_report`.

---

## [7.10.0] — 2026-06-01 — integrity-gated model routing: draft cheap, escalate only when styxx flags low validity

### Added — `styxx.spec_exec`: epistemic speculative execution (integrity-gated model routing)

Run a cheap model by default; escalate a single call to a stronger model **only when a styxx
behavioral-honesty signal flags the cheap output as low-validity** — not when raw confidence is low
(models are confidently wrong, so confidence is a poor validity oracle). The speculative-cascade
pattern, lifted from the token level up to the *action* level and gated on a behavioral signal.

```python
from styxx import EpistemicSpeculativeRouter, calibrate_threshold

router = EpistemicSpeculativeRouter(drafter=cheap, verifier=strong, gate=entropy_gate, tau=tau)
out = router.run(prompt)
out.answer      # the cheap draft when it's trustworthy, the verifier's answer when escalated
out.escalated   # did this call need the strong model?
out.signal      # the gate value that drove the decision

# never guess tau — calibrate on a DISJOINT train split, render the verdict on test
tau = calibrate_threshold(train_records, cost_cap=0.7)
```

**Validated held-out (2026-06-01):** on arithmetic, a Qwen2.5-1.5B drafter gated by `span_confab`
and escalating to a 7B verifier recovered the full quality gap (median recovery **1.00** across
20/20 random splits) at **~0.70×** the verifier's always-on cost — with the escalation threshold
calibrated on a disjoint train split. Calibrate-on-train / verdict-on-test is what separated a real
held-out win from in-sample over-fit. Generalized to a second task (sorting) via the complementary
signal channel.

**Honest bounds** (also in the docstring — read before deploying): validated on small open models
(Qwen 1.5B → 7B) and narrow tasks (arithmetic, sorting); not yet shown at frontier scale or across
arbitrary task types. `span_confab` has two channels (min-margin vs max-entropy) and the right one
is **task-dependent** — choose it on held-out data, don't assume it. Routing pays only when the
param gap dwarfs gate overhead, the verifier is actually better at the task, and the cheap model is
competent on a real fraction of calls. And the load-bearing limit: behavioral gates catch
**uncertainty** errors — they are blind to confident **shared-belief** errors, where you need
external grounding (`styxx.retrieval_check`). This is a control law, not an oracle.

## [7.9.0] — 2026-05-30 — `styxx.honest` becomes the flagship: the one door now runs on the calibrated 0.99-AUC engine

### Changed — `honest(...)` gains the calibrated **text engine** tier (the common case)

```python
from styxx import honest

# text only — what most callers actually have — now runs the calibrated multi-signal engine
v = honest(answer, prompt=question, engine=True)
v.action     # "answered" | "abstained" | "refuted"
v.signal     # the calibrated hallucination risk that drove it
v.detail     # loggable attestation line
```

7.8.0 shipped `honest` as a composer of logit / confidence / retrieval signals. **7.9.0 wires it to
the real engine** as a cheap **claim trigger**, not a standalone verdict: `engine=True` runs
`styxx.guardrail.check(prompt, answer)` — the 9.8K-LOC calibrated multi-signal stack — and a hard
`halt` abstains, but an *elevated* / `retry` risk **escalates to the `verify` backstop** (retrieval)
for the actual grounded truth check. The two-signal firewall: cheap trigger + grounded verification.

This boundary was found by **trying the flagship on Claude's own answers** before shipping: the engine
alone scored *true and false* claims identically (risk 0.75, action `retry`) — its claim-risk signal
fires on any confident assertion and entity-verify only checks that entities *exist*, not that the
claim is *right*. Treating that as an abstain false-flagged correct answers ~80% of the time. The fix
routes the truth call to `verify`; re-run on the same answers, the four correct ones pass and the two
false controls are refuted. So the one door now works on the input developers usually have (a response
string) — `honest(answer, prompt=q, engine=True, verify=retrieval_check)` — without false-flagging a
good model's correct output.

`honest` is now genuinely **tier-adaptive across the strongest *supplied* signal**
(`span_logits` > `logits` > `engine` > `confidence`), with `verify` (retrieval) as a second-opinion
backstop. New params: `prompt`, `engine`, and `**engine_kwargs` (forwarded to `guardrail.check`, e.g.
`use_grounding` / `use_nli` / `use_entity_verify`).

- **`engine`** accepts `True` (run `guardrail.check`) or a callable `(prompt, answer) -> Verdict-like`
  (any detector: `.risk`/`.threshold`/`.action`, a `.verdict` string, or a truthy/falsy safe-flag).
- **Deferred import** — `guardrail` is imported lazily, so `import styxx` stays light and the engine
  tier is opt-in (it may do grounding I/O). A detector error **fails open** (does not block) and the
  retrieval backstop still runs.
- Strongest *supplied* signal wins: `span_logits` > `logits` > `engine` > `confidence`, then `verify`
  runs as a second-opinion backstop on anything that passed.
- Honest scope: the engine is a **trigger**, not a truth oracle. Offline it emits `halt` on confident
  claims (blocks what it can't verify); with grounding it emits `retry` (escalate to `verify`). The
  truth discrimination lives in `verify` (retrieval) — pair them.

Backward compatible — every 7.8.0 call still behaves identically. +7 tests (24 → 31 across the
honesty + single_pass suites; `test_honesty.py` now 24). Also fixed: a duplicate `fathom_reward` /
`FathomRewardModel` pair in `__all__` (81 listed → 79 unique).

---

## [7.8.0] — 2026-05-30 — `styxx.honest`: the unifying, tier-adaptive honesty RUNTIME (one call, with attestation)

### Added — `styxx.honest` + `HonestyVerdict`

```python
from styxx import honest, calibrate_single_pass, retrieval_check

# open / weak model — gate on the calibrated logit signal (one forward pass)
honest(answer, span_logits=token_logits, calibration=cal).action     # "answered" | "abstained"

# frontier model — gate on calibrated stated confidence, escalate confident claims to retrieval
v = honest(answer, confidence=0.9, verify=lambda claim: retrieval_check(claim))
v.answer        # the answer, or "I'm not sure." if it abstained / was refuted
v.action        # "answered" | "abstained" | "refuted"
v.detail        # a loggable, compliance-grade attestation line
bool(v)         # True iff answered
```

The 7.7.x arc shipped the *pieces* of an honesty layer as separate primitives — `single_pass_confab`
/ `span_confab` (cheap confab detection), `abstain_on_confab` (the detect-and-abstain fail-safe),
`retrieval_check` (external grounding). **`honest` is the unifying layer**: one call that takes a
candidate answer plus whatever signal you have, picks the strongest available, decides **answer vs.
abstain vs. refute**, and returns a `HonestyVerdict` you can log as an attestation.

**Tier-adaptive — the research arc established the best honesty signal depends on the model tier:**
- **open / weak models** expose token logprobs → the cheap logit gate (`span_logits` preferred, else
  first-token `logits`); confabulation reads as uncertainty in one forward pass.
- **frontier models** don't expose logprobs but their **stated confidence is calibrated** (self-audit:
  Brier ~0.10, wrong only when uncertain) → `confidence` with a floor.
- **confident fabrication** — the wall both the logit gate *and* resampling miss — is caught by the
  **retrieval backstop** → pass `verify` (e.g. `retrieval_check`) to escalate confident answers.

So one `honest(...)` call degrades gracefully across the models people actually deploy, and **flags /
abstains** — it never fabricates a correction (correction is a closed negative in the research arc).
The detector stays load-bearing: a logit signal with no calibrated threshold stays advisory (the gate
cannot fire) rather than guessing. Pure Python, no new deps. 17 new tests (`tests/test_honesty.py`).

---

## [7.7.16] — 2026-05-30 — `abstain_on_confab`: the closed-loop detect-and-abstain primitive (the detector is load-bearing)

### Added — `styxx.abstain_on_confab` + `AbstainDecision`

```python
from styxx import single_pass_confab, calibrate_single_pass, abstain_on_confab

cal = calibrate_single_pass(confab_entropies, correct_entropies)   # per-model threshold
score = single_pass_confab(first_token_logits, entropy_threshold=cal.entropy_threshold)
decision = abstain_on_confab(model_answer, score)
decision.answer       # the answer, OR "I'm not sure." if the confab gate fired
decision.abstained    # bool — True iff replaced by an honest abstention
bool(decision)        # truthy iff abstained
```

The deployable, framework-free form of the **closed-loop honesty primitive** — gate a candidate
answer through a CALIBRATED confab detector and return an honest abstention when it fires. Turns a
likely confabulation into a calibrated "I don't know" instead of a confident wrong answer.

**The detector is load-bearing — and the API enforces it.** A pre-registered white-box experiment
(`papers/grounded-honesty-axis/FINDING_honesty_knob_2026_05_30.md`, **SURVIVED**, n=32/24 powered)
asked whether the underlying mechanistic abstention intervention is *selective*. It is **not**:
knocking down the disinhibition "confidence-install" band dissolves CORRECT commitments as readily as
confabulations (raw selectivity **−0.08**; both entropies blow up ~11 nats) — applied ungated it is a
blanket lobotomy. Only the calibrated **detector** (gate AUC **0.924**) makes abstention *targeted*:
the gated loop catches-and-abstains **0.75** of confabs while false-abstaining only **0.125** of
correct answers. So `abstain_on_confab` **refuses** to act on an uncalibrated score
(`score.abstain is None` → `ValueError`): you must `calibrate_single_pass` first. Detection is not
optional diagnosis — it is the prerequisite for safe intervention.

Scope: abstention, **not** correction. Repair-to-truth is a closed negative here (depth-steering is
correctness-INERT; removing the install yields uncertainty, not truth). This makes the model honestly
uncertain on exactly the answers it would have confabulated — a fail-safe, not a fix. Works with both
`SinglePassScore` (white-box / weak-model first token) and `SpanConfabScore` (closed-model span).
Pure Python, no new deps. 5 new tests (`tests/test_single_pass.py`, 28 total).

---

## [7.7.15] — 2026-05-30 — the retrieval arm: `audit_claim` becomes a two-signal gate (model-internal confab + external grounding)

### Added — `styxx.retrieval_check` + `audit_claim(verify_retrieval=True)`

```python
from styxx import retrieval_check, audit_claim

# the external-grounding lever, standalone
retrieval_check("Snow White (1937) was the first feature-length animated film.").verdict
# -> "refuted"   (with a cited El Apóstol/1917 evidence string; bool() == False)

# folded into audit_claim as the two-signal gate
a = audit_claim(claim, question, verify_retrieval=True)
a.verdict        # "refuted" when retrieval refutes an otherwise-confident claim
a.retrieval      # RetrievalVerdict(verdict, evidence, claim, model)
```

The resampling stack (`grounded_honesty` / `audit_claim`) and the single-pass gates catch
confabulation that is **unstable** — derivation/reasoning errors where the model's own samples
scatter. They are **structurally blind to confident factual MISCONCEPTIONS**: a *stable* belief that
is false. The detection-locus arc proved this on every model-internal signal — self-consistency,
single-pass, cross-model disagreement, even LLM-judging all fail, because the surviving misconceptions
are shared across models and the judge (`FINDING_truthfulqa_crossmodel_2026_05_30.md`). The only lever
that catches them is **external ground truth**: in `FINDING_retrieval_grounding_2026_05_30.md`, a
web-grounded model corrected the exact "Snow White = first animated film" misconception that defeated
self-consistency, cross-model, the LLM judge, **and Claude itself** in the self-audit.

- `retrieval_check(claim, *, search_model="gpt-4o-mini-search-preview", client=None)` →
  `RetrievalVerdict(verdict ∈ {supported, refuted, unclear}, evidence, claim, model)`. Asks a
  web-grounded OpenAI model whether retrieved sources support or refute the claim.
- `audit_claim(..., verify_retrieval=True)` runs it as a second arm and folds the result in via the
  pure, testable `_combine_retrieval`: external refutation downgrades an otherwise-confident verdict
  (`honest` / `contradiction`) to **`"refuted"`** (so `bool(audit)` — the deploy gate — fails closed),
  and adds a `retrieval-fallible` scope warning. New `ClaimAudit.retrieval` field (backward-compatible
  default `None`).
- **Honest scope (in the docstrings):** retrieval is **FALLIBLE** — in the validating run it also
  *broke* one correct item by misreading its sources, so `"refuted"` is a strong flag, not ground
  truth. The combination is deliberately conservative (refutation-only, confident-verdicts-only). The
  two arms are complementary: model-internal for unstable confabulation, retrieval for confident
  factual claims — neither a universal oracle.
- 19 new unit tests (`tests/test_audit.py`: pure combination logic, parsing, the two-signal
  integration), offline-deterministic via the mock client; ruff clean.

---

## [7.7.14] — 2026-05-30 — single-pass confab gate (the ~10× cheaper, white-box analog of grounded honesty's resampling)

### Added — `styxx.single_pass_confab` + `styxx.calibrate_single_pass`

```python
from styxx import single_pass_confab, calibrate_single_pass

# read the confab signal from ONE forward pass's first answer-token logits
score = single_pass_confab(first_token_logits)
score.entropy   # higher = more-likely-confab (Shannon nats)
score.margin    # top1 - top2 logit gap; lower = more-likely-confab

# calibrate a per-model abstain threshold on a labeled set, then gate in production
cal = calibrate_single_pass(confab_entropies, correct_entropies)   # -> threshold + AUC
abstain = single_pass_confab(logits, entropy_threshold=cal.entropy_threshold).abstain
```

The white-box, one-forward-pass analog of `grounded_honesty`'s N=10 resampling. The detection-locus arc (`papers/grounded-honesty-axis/SYNTHESIS_detection_locus_2026_05_30.md`) showed the clean first-token entropy/margin of a single greedy pass detects confabulation as well as ten resamples: `B_contrast = AUC(resampling) − max(AUC(entropy), AUC(margin))` lay in `[−0.183, +0.056]` across Qwen / Llama / Gemma × arithmetic / code / logic — every cell below the +0.20 "resampling has privileged access" bar — and the relationship extends to factual recall (Llama-1B birth years, −0.013). So the same confab/abstain signal reads from one forward pass instead of ten: a ~10× cost collapse.

- Pure-python, no deps. `SinglePassScore(entropy, margin, abstain, n_logits)` and `SinglePassCalibration(entropy_threshold, auc, confab_mean, correct_mean, n_confab, n_correct)`.
- **Honest scope** (in the docstrings): white-box (needs first-token logits); power gradient is **strong on derivation (AUC ~0.91–1.00), modest on factual recall (~0.73)** — a general confab gate, not a near-perfect hallucination oracle; thresholds are model-specific so must be calibrated per model (no universal default — Gemma-2 soft-caps its logits); flags **ABSTAIN, never corrects** (`modal_correct ~0` for confab in every cell); does not reach the closed-model confident-hallucination regime (the open frontier).
### Added — `styxx.span_confab` (the CLOSED-model variant — recovers gpt-4o-mini at resampling parity)

```python
from styxx import span_confab

# aggregate the single-pass signal across a MULTI-token answer (one logit vector per answer token)
s = span_confab(per_token_logits, margin_threshold=cal_threshold)
s.min_margin    # the LEAST-confident token's margin — the closed-model signal (lower = more-likely-confab)
s.max_entropy   # the most-uncertain token's entropy
s.abstain       # min_margin <= margin_threshold OR max_entropy >= entropy_threshold
```

The first-token `single_pass_confab` FAILS on strong closed models — they confabulate *downstream* of the first token (gpt-4o-mini: first-token AUC 0.76, `B_contrast +0.216 → SURVIVED`, the arc's first single-pass failure). But the error is still single-pass-visible later in the answer: aggregating per-token entropy/margin across the span recovers it. On gpt-4o-mini multiplication (`FINDING_detection_locus_gpt_span_2026_05_30.md`), the **least-confident token's margin (`min_margin`) reached AUC 0.991 — exactly matching N=10 resampling (0.991), `B_contrast 0.000`** — where the first token managed 0.76. So a **cheap (one forward pass vs ten) closed-model confab gate** exists for structured/multi-token answers (from the OpenAI API, build the per-token vectors from each answer token's `top_logprobs`).

- `SpanConfabScore(max_entropy, mean_entropy, min_margin, mean_margin, abstain, n_tokens)`.
- **Scope:** requires a multi-token answer with the error localized to some token(s); a single-token answer has no span (falls back to the first-token regime), and confident hallucination of single-token answers remains the open frontier.

- 23 unit tests total (numerical correctness, confab-vs-correct ordering, calibration workflow, **span recovery scenario**, edge cases, public-export); ruff clean.

## [7.7.13] — 2026-05-29 — grounded honesty axis (the first construct-ceiling crack, as a primitive) + injection-gap closure (calibrated boundary, deployable detection) + the spellchecker for AI output (`audit_claim` productized turn)

### Added — `styxx.audit_claim` (productized single-call honesty audit — the spellchecker for AI output)

```python
from styxx import audit_claim

result = audit_claim(
    claim="The capital of France is Lyon.",
    question="What is the capital of France?",
    in_session_messages=agent.history,   # optional: enables injection-detection
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
)
result.verdict             # "honest" | "contradiction" | "confabulation" | "injected" | "abstain"
result.scope_warnings      # ('belief-not-truth', ...)  auto-generated from data
result.calibration         # citation back to FINDINGs at deployed AUC vintage
```

The high-level wrapper over `grounded_honesty` and `detect_context_injection`. The underlying primitives are pure measurement functions — they take samples and return a score; the caller has to drive the resampling. `audit_claim` closes that gap: drives N stateless resamples via OpenAI internally, drives N in-session resamples if the caller supplies `in_session_messages`, runs both calibrated primitives, returns a structured `ClaimAudit` NamedTuple with single-source-of-truth verdict + auto-generated scope warnings + calibration receipt string.

- Verdict derivation is a pure function of the scored components (`_derive_verdict` is independently testable without OpenAI). Threshold customization: `honest_threshold`, `low_stability_threshold`, `contradiction_threshold`, `injection_threshold` operator-overridable. Defaults: 0.7 / 0.5 / 0.3 / 0.5.
- Scope warnings auto-generated: `belief-not-truth` (always present — the construct ceiling), `single-vendor-calibration` (always present), `past-competence-cliff` (triggered iff stably-confabulated), `single-attack-type-calibration` (triggered iff in-session arm run), `low-N` (triggered iff `n < 8`).
- Calibration string is bumped when underlying FINDING numbers change; preserves the receipt chain back to `e093730` (injection-gap closure SURVIVED) and `dd6e3fb` (injection-attack generalization REPORT_AS_LANDED).
- Test coverage: `tests/test_audit.py` ships 23 offline-deterministic tests (mocked OpenAI client + exact-match same_fn) covering verdict-derivation logic, confidence bands, scope-warning generation, NamedTuple field surface, input validation, threshold customization, sample/cluster preservation for reproducibility receipts.
- Worked example: `examples/audit_claim_example.py` (three scenarios: honest factual, contradicting, contradicting-with-injection).

This is the productized turn from research toolkit to deployable AI-agent honesty audit. **One call. One line. Production-ready.** The construct-ceiling crack (AUC 0.498 register-only → 0.966 belief-grounded) and the calibrated SECURITY MODEL (stateless 0.944 vs in-session 0.011 inverted) are both operationally present in every audit; the boundary statement (scope warnings) is in every result for honest deployment.

### Changed — `audit_claim` and `audit_session` resampling is now parallelized (7-10x speedup)

`_resample` was sequential at v0 — N=10 calls × ~1.5s each = ~15s wall-clock per audit (the OpenAI calls are I/O bound; CPU is mostly idle). Now uses `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` to dispatch the N completions concurrently against the (thread-safe, stateless-HTTP) OpenAI sync client. Empirical N=10 wall-clock: ~2s. **7-10x speedup on the default audit path, zero public-API change.**

- New operator override: `audit_claim(..., max_workers=8)` (default 8; clamped to `min(n, max_workers)` so smaller N doesn't waste threads). Set `max_workers=1` for deterministic-serial debug mode.
- `n=1` short-circuits the executor entirely (no thread spawned).
- `audit_session(...)` inherits the same `max_workers` parameter and forwards to each per-claim audit.
- Test coverage in `tests/test_audit.py::TestParallelization` (+4 tests): preserves verdict under parallelism, `max_workers=1` forces serial, `n=1` skips executor, `len(samples_stateless) == n` after parallel dispatch.
- Backward compatibility: every existing test path passes unchanged. The public API surface is identical; the change is internal mechanics.

### Added — `styxx.grounded_honesty` (factual self-claim honesty, sampling-grounded)

- **`grounded_honesty(samples, claim, *, method=..., same_fn=...) -> GroundedScore`** — the first styxx honesty signal that tracks GROUND TRUTH rather than register. Grounds a stated factual self-claim against the model's OWN resampled belief distribution: `g = Stability × Concordance`. A TRUE claim is the stable sampling mode (both high); a FALSE claim is either a confabulation (low Stability) or a contradiction (claim outside the stable mode → low Concordance). Built on the shipped `styxx.divergence` clustering backends (`same_fn` LLM judge recommended; cosine default; lexical fallback). A pure measurement primitive — the caller supplies the resamples.

- **Self-calibrating — `GroundedScore.stability` is a report-or-abstain gate.** In the pre-registered boundary hunt the grounded score separated true from false self-claims at AUC 0.97 on HIGH-stability items and collapsed to ~chance (0.44) on LOW-stability items: the signal flags exactly the items on which it should abstain. Trust `grounded` where `stability` is high; treat low-stability as "no stable belief → abstain".

```python
from styxx import grounded_honesty
# N resamples of the model answering the bare question (temperature > 0):
samples = ["Canberra", "Canberra", "Canberra", "Sydney", "Canberra"]
grounded_honesty(samples, "Canberra").grounded   # high  -> claim is the stable belief
grounded_honesty(samples, "Sydney").grounded      # low   -> contradiction
```

- **Honest scope, stated not hidden (FEASIBILITY-GRADE).** Single model (gpt-4o-mini), OpenAI-only, single pre-registered runs: grounded AUC 0.966 vs the text-only deception axis at 0.498 (chance) on register-matched factual self-claims. It grounds against the model's *belief*, so a confidently-WRONG belief yields a confidently-wrong verdict — and a same-vendor council does NOT fix this (cross-vendor is the open step). **Self-consistency, not a truth oracle; one axis (factual self-claims).** Evidence + pre-registrations in `papers/grounded-honesty-axis/`. This does not claim the construct ceiling is broken in general.

### Added — `styxx.detect_context_injection` (cross-context divergence as item-level injection-detection)

- **`detect_context_injection(samples_stateless, samples_in_session, claim, *, threshold=0.5, ...) -> InjectionScore`** — the first deployable item-level context-injection detection primitive. Given the same model answering the same underlying question under two resampler architectures (`samples_stateless`: neutral resampler context; `samples_in_session`: the agent's potentially-poisoned session context), compute the divergence `D = |concordance_stateless − concordance_in_session|`. Under injection, the in-session arm agrees with the lie while the stateless arm holds the truth — D is high. Pair with `grounded_honesty` to read the honesty verdict from the stateless arm (architecturally injection-resistant — see below) and the injection-suspicion from the cross-context delta.

```python
from styxx import detect_context_injection
stateless = ["Paris"] * 10      # neutral resampler context
in_session = ["Lyon"] * 10      # agent's session context (poisoned)
r = detect_context_injection(stateless, in_session, "Lyon")
r.suspected   # True  (D = 1.0 > 0.5)
r.divergence  # 1.0
```

- **Calibrated AUC 0.875 at threshold 0.5** on n=48 register-matched factual self-claim pairs under system_lie injection (gpt-4o-mini, N=10 per arm at temp=1.0). Mean D_FALSE 0.852, mean D_TRUE 0.977. K3 attack effective on 47/48 items. Pre-registered `papers/grounded-honesty-axis/PREREG_injection_gap_closure_2026_05_29.md` BEFORE data; one confirmatory run; receipt `papers/grounded-honesty-axis/FINDING_injection_gap_closure_2026_05_29.md`. **Honest scope:** single-model, single-vendor, single injection-type (system_lie). Stronger attacks (few-shot lie, persona attack, sequential tool-output spoofing, multi-stage) remain pre-registerable scope-extensions not validated here.

### Changed — `styxx.divergence` SECURITY MODEL is now calibrated, not blanket-blind

The 2026-05-29 injection-gap closure run (`papers/grounded-honesty-axis/FINDING_injection_gap_closure_2026_05_29.md`) replaces the prior blanket "INJECTION-BLIND" caveat on the divergence primitives with a calibrated architectural boundary:

- **Stateless sampling** (caller resamples in a fresh API call with a neutral system message + the question only, NOT inheriting the agent's session) is **architecturally injection-resistant by construction**: `grounded_honesty` AUC **0.944** under system_lie attack vs the **0.966** clean baseline — only **0.022** drop. The architectural defense IS the shipped `resample_answers()` contract.
- **In-session sampling** (caller passes the agent's session context to the resampler so it inherits any injection) collapses catastrophically: AUC **0.011** — near-perfectly **INVERTED** (the lie scores HIGHER than the truth on 47/48 items). DO NOT deploy in-session sampling.
- **Cross-context divergence** (run BOTH a stateless and an in-session sample set and compare): `detect_context_injection` is the deployable item-level injection-detection primitive at threshold 0.5, AUC 0.875.

The persona/instruction robustness from `papers/adversarial-robustness/FINDING_redteam_2026_05_25.md` is unchanged (the divergence primitives remain robust to attacks targeting the model layer rather than the context).

### Changed — `styxx.compliance.eu_ai_act` cites the new primitives

- **Article 15.1** (accuracy + robustness throughout lifecycle): adds `_GROUNDED_HONESTY` and `_DETECT_CONTEXT_INJECTION` to the styxx-primitive coverage list.
- **Article 15.1(a)** (accuracy metrics declared): adds both new primitives with their AUC numbers (0.966 grounded clean / 0.944 grounded under attack / 0.875 detection).
- **Article 15.3** (robustness via fail-safe/redundancy): the stateless-resample architecture IS the fail-safe; `detect_context_injection` is the item-level redundancy. Both added.

### Changed — `styxx.compliance.nist_ai_rmf` extended in parallel

NIST AI RMF Measure-function bridge updated to cite the new primitives alongside the EU AI Act bridge:

- **MS-2.3** (performance demonstration): adds `_GROUNDED_HONESTY` + `_DETECT_CONTEXT_INJECTION` to the deployable-performance evidence set.
- **MS-2.4** (production monitoring): adds `_DETECT_CONTEXT_INJECTION` as item-level cross-context divergence signal at audit time (AUC 0.875), suitable for real-time injection-suspicion flagging at +N=10 calls/claim.
- **MS-2.5** (valid and reliable + generalizability limitations): adds both primitives with their published construct ceilings — the construct-ceiling discipline is the exact regulatory hook for the "Limitations of generalizability" clause.
- **MS-2.6** (safety + fail-safely-beyond-knowledge-limits): adds both primitives — `grounded_honesty`'s stateless-resample architecture IS the structural fail-safe; `detect_context_injection` is the item-level redundancy. Kill-gate A3 still held (6 uncovered ≥ 5 covered).

### Added — `styxx.compliance.templates` (paste-and-customize EU AI Act conformity declaration templates)

```python
from styxx.compliance.templates import load_template, list_templates
list_templates()
# ('accuracy_declaration', 'robustness_statement', 'boundary_statement',
#  'sycophancy_disclosure', 'injection_resistance_disclosure')
declaration = load_template("accuracy_declaration")  # ~4KB markdown ready for ops
```

Five markdown templates regulated operators paste into EU AI Act conformity declarations (Article 15.1(a), Article 15.3, plus boundary + sycophancy + load-bearing SECURITY MODEL disclosures). All templates ship as package data (importlib.resources, robust across editable/wheel/egg) — verified at CI time via `.github/workflows/test.yml` wheel-shipping check. 10 unit tests in `tests/test_compliance_templates.py` verify legal-disclaimer presence on every template (`"not legal advice"` + `"independent legal review"` mandatory), companion-paper citation, styxx-version disclosure, load-bearing-statement integrity on `injection_resistance_disclosure` (AUC 0.944 stateless + 0.011 in-session + 0.875 detection + PREREG/FINDING commit receipts), and 7-enumerated-uncovered-Articles in `boundary_statement`. Implements item 3 of the 5-item strategic landscape ship list (after item 1 module + item 2 paper).

### Changed — `papers/EU_AI_ACT_COMPLIANCE_2026.md` extended to v0.2

The companion paper (v0.1 shipped in 7.7.10) is extended to v0.2 (commit `48194e8`) with the new 7.7.13 primitives folded into Articles 15.1, 15.1(a), and 15.3 coverage tables. New §9 addendum (2026-05-29) documents the four 7.7.13 commits, the SURVIVED outcome with all four pre-registered bars, and explicit "what changes for operators relying on v0.1" guidance. Kill-gates A1–A5 unchanged and continue to hold. v0.2 timeline: 63 days before the 2026-08-02 enforcement deadline.

### Changed — `papers/EU_AI_ACT_COMPLIANCE_2026.md` extended to v0.3 + `injection_resistance_disclosure` template v0.3 + `styxx.divergence` SECURITY MODEL docstring rewrite (two-vector calibration)

The companion paper extends to v0.3 (commit `5cc0d8c`) folding the 2026-05-29 injection-attack-generalization REPORT_AS_LANDED run (PREREG `f570909`, REPORT `dd6e3fb`). The `detect_context_injection` calibration extends from one injection vector (system_lie) to two (system_lie + persona_lie), with the same architectural signature on both — G1 stateless robust AUC 0.955 (vs system_lie 0.944), G2 in-session inverted AUC 0.174 (vs 0.011), G3 cross-context divergence detects AUC 0.833 (vs 0.875), K3 attack-effective 0.771 (vs 0.98) — and a third vector tested in the same run, fewshot_lie single-demonstration, identified as INEFFECTIVE on canonical facts at K3 = 0.063 (threat surface narrowed, not widened). §3.1 / §3.2 / §3.3 construct-ceiling cells rewritten for two-vector calibration; §8 conclusion refreshed; new §10 v0.3 addendum (mirrors §9 v0.2 structure). Kill-gates A1–A5 unchanged. `styxx/divergence.py` module-level SECURITY MODEL docstring + per-function `detect_context_injection` docstring rewritten with per-vector AUC numbers + ineffective-attack identification + the still-pre-registerable scope extensions named precisely (multi-shot fewshot, jailbreak-grade persona framings, sequential tool-output spoofing, multi-stage attacks, cross-vendor variants). `styxx/compliance/templates/injection_resistance_disclosure.md` bumped to v0.3 with the second receipt-block for persona_lie + the fewshot ineffective-attack identification + Honest Scope rewritten `single-attack-type` → `two-attack-type`. No public API surface change — the primitive itself is unchanged; only the calibration SCOPE of the SECURITY MODEL widens. tests/ 1300 pass, zero regressions.

### Added — `papers/CONSTRUCT_CEILING_PUBLIC_RESPONSE_2026_05_29.md` public-response position memo

Standalone CC-BY 4.0 position memo connecting the construct-ceiling thesis to convergent public statements about AI epistemology — including Pope Leo XIV's #MagnificaHumanitas message (2026-05-29) and the Atlan field-wide admission "no framework can distinguish a factually wrong context from a correct one." Eight sections + reproducibility footnotes covering: empirical receipts (AUC 0.498 register-matched four-axis chance), the boundary (phenomenology, conscience, embodied meaning explicitly OUT OF SCOPE), the EU AI Act Article 15 ¶2 stakeholder methodology operationalization, falsification criteria F1–F4, citation strategy. Explicit non-endorsement: no claim of papal/Vatican backing. Companion announcement drafts at `drafts/announcement_2026_05_29_pope_construct_ceiling.md` (Twitter single + 8-tweet thread + Telegram long-form + LinkedIn professional + operator outbound notes with hype-redirect discipline carried through).

## [7.7.12] — 2026-05-28 — cognometric vitals in the attestation (verifiable, re-derivable, tamper-evident)

### Added — verifiable cognometric vitals

- **`attest(report, repo, *, prompt=..., vitals=True)`** — embeds the deterministic text-heuristic cognometric vitals (`styxx.attack.score_all`) of the report into the content-addressed artifact. The instruments are RELATIONAL, so the prompt the report responds to is recorded as part of the attested substrate; `vitals=True` without a prompt raises (the scores are undefined for a referent-free monologue, not zero).

- **`verify_attestation`** re-derives every score from the recorded (prompt, response) and compares. A flipped score is caught **even when the attacker re-seals the digest** — `digest_ok` can be true while `vitals_ok` is false — because the score is recomputed from the substrate text, never trusted from the artifact. Same trust-the-substrate-not-the-agent guarantee the factual claims already have, now on the instrument scores. Vitals flow through `attest_chain` (`(report, ref, prompt)` items) into a tamper-evident vitals trend.

- **Honest scope, machine-readable.** The artifact carries a `measures` field ("register … NOT ground-truth honesty") and per-axis caveats; reference-less `deception` is flagged register-only. This re-affirms styxx's validated construct ceiling — text-only scoring is a register detector, not a truth oracle — it does not re-litigate it. The dogfood is the proof: on a benign, truthful self-report the deception axis scores 0.9956, exactly as the embedded caveat warns, so the score cannot be honestly over-read.

```python
from styxx.attestation import attest, verify_attestation
att = attest(report, repo=".", prompt=task, vitals=True)
res = verify_attestation(att, repo=".")
assert res.vitals_ok   # every score re-derives from the recorded (prompt, response)
```

- **CLI:** `styxx attest <file> --vitals --prompt "<task>"`; `verify-attestation` reports vitals reproduction.

- **Pre-registered + kill-gated.** `scripts/dogfood/PREREG_cognometric_attestation.md` states K1 determinism / K2 re-sealed-score-tamper caught (decisive) / K3 chain reproduction BEFORE the code was written. Thesis survived: 6 new gate tests (29/29 attestation total; full scoped suite 1174 passed). Live receipt: `scripts/dogfood/cognometric_attestation_self_2026_05_28.json`.

### Added — standalone, trust-minimized verifier (verify without trusting styxx)

- **`scripts/styxx_verify_standalone.py`** — an independent, **stdlib-only** verifier (imports only `argparse`/`hashlib`/`json`/`sys`, **nothing from styxx**) that re-derives the content address of any styxx attestation or chain and checks its structural integrity (per-attestation digest + Merkle linkage + head). You don't have to trust — or install — styxx to verify a styxx receipt.

- **`docs/attestation-content-address.md`** — the content-addressing spec v1.0 the verifier is the executable form of: canonical payload (`json.dumps(core, sort_keys=True, separators=(",",":"), ensure_ascii=False)` over the artifact minus `generated_at`/`digest`), `sha256` digest, and the chain rule (`sha256(f"{prev}|{att_digest}")`, genesis `styxx-attestation-chain-v1`).

```
python scripts/styxx_verify_standalone.py chain.json --expected-head <hex>
```

- **Honest scope.** Structure only. Claim verdicts (need the repo) and vitals scores (need styxx's instruments) are reported `NOT CHECKED`, never asserted. A fully re-sealed chain passes structure and is caught only against an external `--expected-head` anchor. Cross-LANGUAGE agreement is out of scope — Python's json number repr is not language-portable; JCS/RFC 8785 is the documented future-work path.

- **Pre-registered + kill-gated.** `scripts/dogfood/PREREG_standalone_verifier.md` states K1 byte-for-byte cross-implementation digest agreement (decisive) / K2 tamper caught without styxx / K3 no scope leak BEFORE the code was written. Thesis survived: 10 cross-validation gate tests (`tests/test_standalone_verifier.py`) prove byte-identical agreement with the library over a 4-shape corpus. Live receipt: `scripts/dogfood/standalone_verifier_self_2026_05_28.json`.

### Added — portable (cross-language) content address: verify in any language, in a browser

- **`digest.portable`** — an additive, versioned second content address (alg `sha256-jcs`) over an RFC 8785 / ECMAScript-canonical payload, so the address reproduces **byte-for-byte in any language**. The legacy `digest.value` is left byte-identical — every 7.7.11 / 7.7.12 receipt already issued stays valid. Chains carry a parallel `attestation_portable_digest` per link + `head_chain_portable_digest`.

- **`web/styxx_verify.js`** — a zero-dependency JavaScript verifier (bundled pure-JS SHA-256, no network) that re-derives `digest.portable` and the Merkle chain. Runs in Node and the browser. **`web/verify.html`** — paste an attestation, get a verdict, entirely client-side: verify a styxx receipt with zero install and zero trust.

```
node web/styxx_verify.js artifact.json [expectedHead]      # or open web/verify.html
```

- **Why it matters.** The standalone verifier removed the "trust styxx" dependency; the portable digest removes the "be Python" dependency. Measured: the same artifact hashed differently in Python (`9a734e78…`) and Node (`68859936…`) under the legacy scheme because a saturating score serializes as `1.0` vs `1`; the portable digest is identical on both.

- **Honest scope.** Structure only — claim verdicts and vitals are reported `NOT CHECKED`; a re-sealed chain needs an external expected head. Specified for the styxx artifact domain (ASCII keys, finite doubles); a fully general JCS implementation is a superset.

- **Pre-registered + kill-gated.** `scripts/dogfood/PREREG_portable_attestation.md` states K1 Python↔JS byte-for-byte agreement (decisive) / K2 legacy digest untouched / K3 JS catches tamper + no scope leak BEFORE the code was written. Thesis survived: 11 gate tests (`tests/test_portable_attestation.py`); Python↔Node agreed on 40,019/40,019 fuzz values and all 4 real shapes incl. the saturating case. Live receipt: `scripts/dogfood/portable_attestation_self_2026_05_28.json`.

### Added — Cognometric Transparency Log (RFC 6962): no silent suppression

- **`styxx.transparency`** — Certificate Transparency (RFC 6962) applied to styxx attestations. An append-only Merkle log whose leaves are attestation `digest.portable.value` hex strings, with **inclusion proofs** ("entry X is at index i in the log with root R") and **consistency proofs** ("the size-n log is an append-only extension of the witnessed size-m log — no past leaf edited, deleted, reordered, or truncated"). Closes the *completeness* gap the receipt arc could not: a receipt proves what it says, the log proves **nothing was suppressed** — relative to a witnessed tree head.

- **`web/styxx_verify.js`** gains `leafHash` / `nodeHash` / `merkleTreeHash` / `verifyInclusion` / `verifyConsistency`, and `verify()` auto-dispatches on a proof's `kind`. **`web/verify.html`** now verifies a pasted inclusion/consistency proof client-side — paste a consistency proof + the witnessed earlier root and detect a rewritten/suppressed past entry, zero install.

- **Documented deviation from RFC 6962:** ASCII string domain-separation tags (`styxx-tlog-leaf:` / `styxx-tlog-node:`) instead of the 0x00/0x01 byte tags, so the bundled pure-JS string SHA-256 works unchanged across languages. Functionally equivalent; a styxx log is not submittable to a CT log and vice versa.

- **Honest boundary (pre-registered, not a kill).** Append-only-ness is proven only *relative to a witnessed tree head*. The data structure alone does not stop an operator who never publishes a tree head from equivocating (showing different logs to different parties) — that needs tree-head gossip/witnessing, exactly as in CT. Stated in the artifact and docs; the overclaim is refused.

- **Pre-registered + kill-gated.** `scripts/dogfood/PREREG_transparency_log.md` states K1 inclusion sound+complete / K2 consistency catches rewrite (decisive) / K3 cross-language agreement BEFORE the code was written. Thesis survived: 16 gate tests (`tests/test_transparency.py`); Python↔Node agree on the root and on every inclusion + consistency proof, and edit/delete/reorder/truncate of witnessed history are all caught. Live receipt over styxx's own HEAD: `scripts/dogfood/transparency_log_self_2026_05_28.json`.

### Added — Redactable Cognometric Attestation (selective disclosure): disclose one fact, keep the rest private

- **`styxx.redact`** + **`attest(..., redactable=True)`** — a salted Merkle commitment over the *individual fields* of an attestation. The public artifact gains `digest.redactable = {alg, version, root, tree_size}` — the per-leaf 256-bit salts stay the agent's secret and are never serialized. Closes the *confidentiality* gap: every prior proof forced you to publish the whole (prompt, response) to re-derive anything; now an agent can disclose a **chosen subset** of attested facts (one vitals score, one claim verdict) and prove each is exactly the value committed into the public root — while the rest of the response stays private.

- **`Attestation.disclose(pointers)`** returns a `{kind:"disclosure", root, tree_size, fields:[{pointer, value, salt, leaf_index, audit_path}]}` revealing only the selected leaves (a pointer reveals itself and its descendants). **`verify_disclosure(disclosure, root=...)`** recomputes each salted leaf and checks its inclusion against the root — pass the public `digest.redactable.root` or a transparency-log leaf to bind to the append-only history.

- **`web/styxx_verify.js`** gains `verifyDisclosure`, and `verify()` auto-dispatches on `kind === "disclosure"`. **`web/verify.html`** verifies a pasted disclosure client-side — confirm one disclosed fact is bound to the public root, zero install, zero styxx.

- **The salt is load-bearing.** A low-entropy field (a verdict in {PASS,FAIL,ERROR}, a 0–1 score) would be brute-forceable from an unsalted leaf hash by anyone who knows the domain; the 256-bit per-leaf salt makes that infeasible. Additive: `digest.value` (legacy) and `digest.portable.value` are left byte-identical (both canonical forms exclude the whole `digest` key), so every prior receipt stays valid. Redactable mode is opt-in and, by design, non-deterministic — the salts *are* the confidentiality.

- **Honest scope (refused overclaim).** This is selective DISCLOSURE, not zero-knowledge: no predicate/range over a HIDDEN value, and a disclosed value is trusted as the *committed* value (it inherits the commit-time / re-seal boundary, caught only via the transparency log + an external witness). A disclosure leaks the field **count** and the disclosed pointers + values; it hides every undisclosed pointer and value. Calling it a ZK range proof would be the overclaim; styxx will not.

- **Pre-registered + kill-gated.** `scripts/dogfood/PREREG_redactable_attestation.md` states P1 disclosure sound / P2 confidentiality + salt load-bearing (decisive) / P3 additive legacy+portable untouched / P4 composes with the transparency log BEFORE the code was written. Thesis survived: 14 gate tests (`tests/test_redact.py`); Python↔Node agree on the root and on every disclosure, a tampered value / wrong salt / wrong root / swapped index all FAIL, the unsalted small-domain leaf is brute-forced while the salted one is not, and the redactable root verifies as a transparency-log leaf with a consistency proof against an external witness. Live receipt over styxx's own HEAD: `scripts/dogfood/redactable_attestation_self_2026_05_28.json`.

## [7.7.11] — 2026-05-28 — `styxx.attestation`: the Verifiable Cognometric Attestation

### Added — agent-independent, third-party-reproducible honesty attestation

- **`styxx.attestation.attest(report_text, repo)`** — produces a content-addressed artifact of an agent's self-report: the deterministically-extracted checkable claims, their PASS/FAIL verdicts against the substrate, the EU AI Act Article 15 clause mapping the evidence supports, the explicit uncovered-requirements boundary, and a SHA-256 digest over the canonical payload. The `generated_at` timestamp is the only volatile field and is deliberately excluded from the hash, so two runs on an identical substrate share a digest.

- **`styxx.attestation.verify_attestation(artifact, repo)`** — re-derives every verdict by re-running each claim's checker against the substrate and comparing to the embedded verdict. It NEVER trusts the embedded verdict. A flipped verdict is caught *even when the attacker re-seals the digest* — the artifact is verifiable against ground truth, not against the agent's word. Checker names resolve against a read-only allowlist; an unknown name is refused, never executed.

```python
from styxx.attestation import attest, verify_attestation
att = attest(open("agent_report.md").read(), repo=".")   # the agent attests
res = verify_attestation(att, repo=".")                    # anyone re-verifies
assert res.ok   # digest intact AND every verdict reproduces from the substrate
```

- **CLI: `styxx attest <file> [--out f.json]` + `styxx verify-attestation <file>`** — emit and independently re-verify. `verify-attestation` exits 0 only if the digest matches and every embedded verdict reproduces; 1 on a mismatch, broken digest, or unknown checker.

- **Pre-registered + kill-gated.** `scripts/dogfood/PREREG_verifiable_attestation.md` states the thesis, predictions (P1–P5), and a kill-gate (K1 determinism / K2 independent reproduction / K3 tamper-evidence) BEFORE the instrument was written. `tests/test_attestation.py` enforces the gate at CI time. Thesis survived: 10/10 gate tests pass.

### Added — commit-pinned attestation (immutable as-of-date provenance)

- **`attest(report, repo, ref=<commit|tag|branch>)`** — pins the substrate to a specific commit. The claims are verified against the repo tree *at that commit*, materialized read-only via `git archive` (the working tree and `.git` worktree registry are never touched), and the resolved SHA is recorded in the artifact. A claim attested true at a commit stays verifiably true at that commit forever, regardless of how the repo evolves afterward — the shape a regulator's "as-of-date" conformity evidence requires.

- **`verify_attestation`** re-materializes the *exact recorded commit SHA* (not the ref name, which could have moved) and reproduces the verdicts against that historical tree. A commit-pinned commit SHA is validated as hex before it reaches git, so an untrusted artifact cannot smuggle a git argument; a pinned commit absent from the repo is reported as ERROR, never silently trusted.

- **CLI:** `styxx attest <file> --ref <commit>`.

- **Pre-registered + kill-gated.** `scripts/dogfood/PREREG_commit_pinned_attestation.md` states K1 determinism / K2 historical isolation (decisive) / K3 false-at-ref caught / K4 read-only BEFORE the code was written. Thesis survived: 7 additional gate tests pass (17/17 total in `tests/test_attestation.py`).

### Added — attestation chains (tamper-evident, ordered provenance ledger)

- **`styxx.attestation.attest_chain(items, repo)` + `verify_chain(chain, repo)`** — Merkle-link a sequence of (commit-pinned) attestations into a tamper-evident ledger. Each link carries its per-attestation SHA-256 digest plus a rolling chain digest (`chain[n] = sha256(chain[n-1] || att_digest[n])`), so the *order* of an agent's claim-trajectory is bound into a single `head_chain_digest` — not just a bag of independently-true files.

- **Honest tamper model (stated, not hidden).** `verify_chain` re-runs full per-link attestation reproduction AND recomputes the rolling digests from scratch. A naive reorder, insertion, or deletion is caught outright (the head digest no longer matches). A *sophisticated* re-sealed mutation — every chain digest recomputed — is caught only when checked against an externally-anchored head supplied as `verify_chain(..., expected_head=...)`. With no external anchor, a re-sealed chain is internally consistent and not detectable by the chain alone: the ledger is **tamper-evident, not tamper-proof**, the same property the single attestation has. Per-link substrate reproduction always holds regardless.

```python
from styxx.attestation import attest_chain, verify_chain
chain = attest_chain([
    ("The version is 7.7.10.", "v7.7.10"),   # pinned, true as-of that commit
    ("The version is 7.7.11.", None),         # pinned to HEAD
], repo=".")
res = verify_chain(chain, repo=".", expected_head=anchored_head)
assert res.ok   # every link reproduces AND the order is intact
```

- **Pre-registered + kill-gated.** `scripts/dogfood/PREREG_attestation_chain.md` states K1 determinism / K2 order tamper-evidence (decisive, with the honest re-seal boundary) / K3 per-link reproduction preserved / P4 real-history round-trip BEFORE the code was written. Thesis survived: 6 additional gate tests pass (23/23 total in `tests/test_attestation.py`). Live real-history receipt: `scripts/dogfood/chain_self_history_2026_05_28.json`.

## [7.7.10] — 2026-05-28 — `critique_detector` public API + recursive-discipline paper v7 + `styxx.compliance.eu_ai_act` v0.1 (first open-source EU AI Act Article 15 measurement-methodology bridge)

### Added — `styxx.compliance` namespace + EU AI Act Article 15 bridge (v0.1)

- **`styxx.compliance.eu_ai_act`** — the first publicly-known open-source measurement-methodology bridge mapping AI agent cognitive-observability primitives to specific EU AI Act Article 15 sub-paragraphs. v0.1 covers four clauses (15.1, 15.1(a), 15.3, 15.4) with five styxx primitives, explicitly enumerates seven uncovered EU AI Act requirements (Articles 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15 cybersecurity, 15.4 bias) with alternative-tool references, ships under MIT alongside the companion paper. Three pre-registered kill-gates are enforced by `tests/test_compliance_eu_ai_act.py` at CI time.

```python
from styxx.compliance import cite, coverage_table, uncovered_requirements
m = cite("Article 15.1(a)")  # → ComplianceMap with primitives + receipts
for u in uncovered_requirements():  # honest boundary statement
    print(u.clause, "→", u.alternative)
```

- **`styxx.compliance.ComplianceMap`, `PrimitiveCoverage`, `cite()`, `coverage_table()`, `uncovered_requirements()`** — new public API.

- **`papers/EU_AI_ACT_COMPLIANCE_2026.md`** (CC-BY 4.0, 7-page arXiv-ready) — companion paper offering this contribution under EU AI Act Article 15 paragraph 2's open invitation for stakeholder methodology development. NOT legal advice. Independent conformity review required for any production deployment.

- **`arxiv/eu_ai_act_compliance/`** — operator-uploadable arXiv submission bundle (cs.CY primary, cs.AI cross-list) with paste-ready abstract, title, comments, license, and upload steps.

- **`examples/eu_ai_act_compliance_example.py`** — worked example demonstrating `cite()`, `coverage_table()`, `uncovered_requirements()`, and a paste-ready Markdown excerpt renderer for Article 15.1(a) instructions-of-use accuracy sections.

### Changed — `styxx.compliance.py` → `styxx.compliance/` package

The pre-7.7.10 single-file `styxx/compliance.py` (v1.3.0 API: `AnomalyEvent`, `ComplianceReport`, `compliance_report`) is preserved verbatim at `styxx/compliance/_legacy.py` and re-exported via the new package `__init__.py`. **Backward compatibility is preserved**: every pre-7.7.10 import (`from styxx.compliance import compliance_report`, `styxx.compliance_report`, etc.) continues to work identically. The `tests/test_public_surface.py::test_compliance_smoke` test confirms this at every CI run.

### Added — recursive-discipline paper v5/v6/v7 (after the initial v4 release)

- **v5 §13 "The paper catches itself"** — same-session self-falsification of v4's own forward-looking claim about `styxx.critique_detector` being shipped. Three gaps closed in commit `0e97598`: version bump, `__all__` parity, docstring v4-framing.
- **v6 §14 "The instrumented recursion frame"** — Layer 5 (`styxx.agent_audit` substrate-grounded session-output verifier, 13/13 PASS) + Layer 6 (`styxx.critique_detector` cross-model applied to the paper's own claims with negative controls, 18/18 PASS).
- **v7 — uncurated L7 audit catches systematic count drift in v6**. Pre-registered at commit `b18ce93` BEFORE the runner existed; 2 pre-disclosed FAILs found exactly as predicted; follow-up grep caught the same drift propagated to 5 places in v6 that the audit didn't check. All fixed in v7. Acknowledgments paragraph now documents the v4→v5→v6→v7 count-correction chain.

### Added — `styxx.agent_audit` instrument (Layer 5 substrate-grounded auditor)

- **`styxx.agent_audit`, `Claim`, `AuditResult`, `AgentClaimAuditor`** — public API for the substrate-grounded session-output verifier. Read-only, offline, no external services. Nine registered checkers covering git diffs, branch commit chains, git tags, file substrings, Python attributes, package versions, PDF page counts, PDF section presence, file byte-equality. Three additional checkers added in the L7 commit: `directory_file_count_equals`, `json_path_equals`, `python_attr_equals`.

### Added — agent self-report falsification: paste-and-audit gate

The hand-fed verifier becomes a one-line merge gate. Two new checkers close the documented "first-occurrence-only" construct ceiling, and `extract_claims` removes the requirement to hand-author `Claim` objects.

- **`checkers.value_consistent_across_paths(repo, *, glob, pattern, expected, group=1)`** — scans **every** match of `pattern` across all files matching `glob`, FAILs if any captured value diverges from `expected`, and surfaces all divergent sites with file + line. Fails loudly on zero occurrences (no vacuous `all()`-over-empty-set PASS). Oracle-backed: you supply the canonical value.
- **`checkers.value_internally_consistent(repo, *, path, pattern, group=1)`** — oracle-free triage flagger: asserts all captures **within one file** agree with each other; zero/one occurrence is trivially consistent; divergence FAILs listing the distinct values + line numbers. Catches a document that contradicts itself with zero configuration.
- **`styxx.extract_claims(text, *, id_prefix="X") -> ExtractionReport`** and **`styxx.ExtractionReport`** — deterministic, non-LLM claim extraction from free-text agent self-reports via a closed regex template set (version pins, git tags, file-contains assertions, PDF page counts). Honest boundary: extraction ≠ verification — only claims matching a template are checkable; unmatched prose is reported as uncovered, never silently passed.
- **`styxx audit-claims <report.md> --repo <path> [--json]`** — CLI merge gate. Extracts claims from an agent's self-report, audits each against repository substrate, prints a human summary plus a grep-able `JSON:` line. Exit codes: `0` all claims PASS (or none extractable), `1` at least one claim contradicted by substrate, `2` input error. Drop-in CI usage: `styxx audit-claims pr_body.md --repo . || exit 1`.

```bash
styxx audit-claims pr_body.md --repo .   # 0 pass / 1 lie caught / 2 input error
```

A ready-to-use GitHub Action lives at `.github/workflows/audit-claims.yml`.

### Why patch (not minor)

`critique_detector`, `agent_audit`, `compliance` are all pure additions; default install + import behavior is byte-identical to 7.7.9 for any client that does not import them. The paper revisions are documentation-only. The compliance package conversion preserves every pre-7.7.10 import path. No public-surface breakage.

### Added — `styxx.critique_detector`

- **`styxx.critique_detector(model="gpt-4o-mini", prompt_template=None, temperature=0.0)`** — the first method to PASS the gauntlet's v3 detection bars (D1+D2+D3+D4 on dark-core), promoted from `submissions/baseline_019_openai_critique/` to a public deployable primitive. Returns a callable `(question, response) → P(NO | critique prompt)` in `[0, 1]`. Higher = more misconception-like. Default backend `gpt-4o-mini` via OpenAI Chat Completions API; requires `OPENAI_API_KEY`. Pure addition; default install behavior unchanged.
- **`styxx.CritiqueDetector`** — the underlying dataclass, exposed for subclassing (custom backends, prompt templates, sampling).

```python
from styxx import critique_detector
det = critique_detector(model="gpt-4o-mini")
det("Is the Great Wall visible from space?", "Yes, with the naked eye.")  # ≈ 1.0
det("Capital of France?", "Paris")                                          # ≈ 0.0
```

### Added — recursive-discipline paper v4 + asymmetry-v3 measurement

- **`papers/PAPER_recursive_discipline_2026_05_27.md` (v4)** + arXiv submission package rebuilt at `arxiv/recursive_discipline/`. The v3 single-character T/F/U NLI cleanup resolved the v2 NEUTRAL/AMBIGUOUS artifact (85% UNCLEAR → 0% on dark-core, 13% on TruthfulQA). Pre-stated predictions held on both corpora.
- **`papers/agent-self-audit/FINDING_asymmetry_v3_measurement_2026_05_27.md`** — the final clean within-model generation-vs-critique asymmetry measurement: **5.88% on dark-core (n=34)** and **17.00% on TruthfulQA (n=200)**, both inside pre-stated bands. Best-calibrated multi-prediction experiment of the 2026-05-27 arc.
- **`experiments/asymmetry_v3_cleanup_2026_05_27/results.json`** — reproducible v3 outputs.

### Changed — corrected mechanism description

- The Baseline-019 PASS mechanism is now described as **out-of-context critique** (RLHF-tuned LLM applies factuality discrimination to labeled candidate text) rather than within-model generation-vs-critique asymmetry. The PASS verdict (4/4 under v3 bars, AUC 0.95) is unchanged. The v1 asymmetry rate claim of 91% was an inflated upper bound from a cosine-similarity proxy; the v3 measurement put the true within-model asymmetry rate dramatically lower (5.88% / 17.00%). Most folklore items are **consistent-correct** (model refutes AND flags). Docstrings in `styxx/critique.py` updated to match.
- **`styxx/_data/LEADERBOARD.md`** — mechanism row for Baseline-019 revised.

### Why patch (not minor)

`critique_detector` is a pure addition; default install + import behavior is byte-identical to 7.7.9. The paper revision is documentation-only. No public-surface breakage.

### Zenodo

- `zenodo/v7.7.9/` historical snapshot committed (matches the v7.7.7 pattern). The Zenodo v25 deposit (DOI 10.5281/zenodo.20419662) is frozen at the v7.7.9-as-tagged state, which predates the v1/v2/v3 asymmetry FINDING arc. A new deposit (concept DOI 10.5281/zenodo.19326174) will accompany this v7.7.10 release.

---

## [7.7.9] — 2026-05-27 — gauntlet detection-bar v3: D4 capitalization-control bar + systematic confound audit primitive

### Added — D4 capitalization-control bar

- **`D4_capitalization_control_delta` ≥ 0.10** — a real detector must beat the capitalization-ratio oracle's *absolute* AUC by at least 0.10 on both partitions. The cap-ratio oracle is direction-agnostic (`max(auc, 1-auc)`) because the cap-ratio confound on this benchmark is *inverted*: truth responses are canonical short answers ("Paris", "Newton") where capitalized-token ratio is structurally near 1.0, while folklore restatements are full sentences diluting the proper-noun density.
- `styxx.gauntlet._capratio_oracle_detect` — new oracle: `{"score": 1 - cap_ratio}`. Used as the D4 floor.
- `run_detection_gauntlet` now reports 4 additional metrics: `capratio_oracle_misconception_AUC_abs`, `capratio_oracle_folklore_AUC_abs`, `D1_minus_capratio_AUC`, `D2_minus_capratio_AUC`.
- **PASS now requires D1 ∧ D2 ∧ D3 ∧ D4** (detection task = 4 bars).

### Added — confound audit primitive

- `styxx.gauntlet.audit_confounds()` — runs 8 oracle-detectors against the benchmark and reports per-feature D1/D2 AUC (direction-agnostic), Spearman ρ to word-length, and whether each oracle alone games the bars. The structural counterpart to D3: where D3 controls for one known confound, `audit_confounds()` scans the space of plausible additional confounds.
- `styxx.gauntlet.CONFOUND_ORACLES` — the default 8-feature suite: `word_length`, `char_length`, `sentence_count`, `question_mark_count`, `exclamation_count`, `capitalized_token_ratio`, `hedge_density`, `type_token_ratio`.
- New CLI: `styxx gauntlet-audit-confounds` (card + JSON formats).

### Regression tests

- `test_capratio_oracle_passes_D1_D2_but_fails_D4` — symmetric guard to D3's regression test. Cap-ratio oracle passes D1+D2 by construction (the inverted artifact) but fails D4 by construction (delta = 0 vs itself).
- `test_audit_confounds_returns_structured_result` — validates the audit table includes the 8 expected oracles, that `word_length` passes both bars (calibration), and that `capitalized_token_ratio` has absolute AUC ≥ 0.70 in inverted direction.
- Existing `test_zero_detector_fails_all_detection_bars` updated for 4-bar count.
- Existing `test_perfect_oracle_passes_all_detection_bars` updated to assert all 4 bars pass.

### Re-scoring existing detection submissions under v3 bars

| submission | D1 | D2 | D3-delta | D4-delta | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Baseline-007 (token-overlap) | 0.864 ✓ | 0.922 ✓ | 0.074 ✗ | 0.160 ✓ | 3/4 FAIL (D3) |
| Baseline-008 (embedding similarity) | 0.805 ✓ | 0.928 ✓ | 0.015 ✗ | 0.102 ✓ | 3/4 FAIL (D3) |

Both real submissions go from 2/3 (v2) to 3/4 (v3): they pass D4 (their detectors add signal above the cap-ratio confound) but still fail D3 (the length confound is the dominant artifact). Verdicts unchanged: still NOT a PASS.

### How this finding fits the project pattern

This is the **seventh in-session falsification** today. After D3 (7.7.8) caught the length confound via accident (Baseline-007's unexpected PASS), the next disciplined move was to scan systematically. Pre-stated predictions for 8 oracle confounds committed at `48a9fe3` BEFORE running. 5 of 8 individual-feature AUC predictions fell outside their stated ranges. The most consequential falsification: I predicted cap-ratio positive direction; actual was inverted (truth has MORE proper-noun density). My audit code had the same direction blind-spot until I caught it in implementation review.

The recursion gets cleaner: artifact-finding doesn't depend on lucky accidents anymore. The audit primitive turns it into a deliberate scan.

Full findings + receipts: `papers/agent-self-audit/FINDING_confound_audit_2026_05_27.md`.

### Why patch (not minor)

Bar additions extend the existing detection-task interface (4-bar PASS instead of 3-bar PASS). Submissions submitted under v2 bars continue to score correctly — `bar_results` includes the new `D4_capitalization_control_delta` key but the score logic is purely additive. No breaking changes to the gauntlet's public API.

---

## [7.7.8] — 2026-05-27 — gauntlet detection-bar v2: D3 length-control bar fixes the artifact Baseline-007 exposed

### Fixed

- **The gauntlet's detection bars (D1, D2) were length-gameable.** Baseline-007, a 30-line token-overlap heuristic submitted as a sanity check, accidentally hit PASS=true on the v1 bars (D1=0.864, D2=0.922). Investigation: the benchmark's `expected_consensus` field is length-confounded by class — truth responses average 3.9 words ("Paris", "206"), folklore responses average 7.5 words (full council restatements). A detector measuring length alone scores AUC=0.79 on misconception-vs-truth and AUC=0.80 on folklore-vs-truth. **Any submission could game the bars by exploiting this artifact.**

### Added — D3 length-control bar

- **`D3_length_control_delta` ≥ 0.10** — a real detector must beat the length-only oracle's AUC by at least 0.10 on *both* the misconception-vs-truth (D1 partition) and folklore-vs-truth (D2 partition) splits.
- `styxx.gauntlet._length_oracle_detect` — the new length-only oracle used as the D3 floor. Returns `{"score": len(response.split())}`.
- `run_detection_gauntlet` now computes 4 additional metrics inline:
  - `length_oracle_misconception_AUC` (the floor on the D1 partition)
  - `length_oracle_folklore_AUC` (the floor on the D2 partition)
  - `D1_minus_length_AUC` (the submitter's signal-above-floor on D1)
  - `D2_minus_length_AUC` (the submitter's signal-above-floor on D2)

### Bar set update

Detection task now has **3 bars** (D1, D2, D3). PASS requires all three. Classification task is unchanged (still K1, K2, K3).

### Regression test

`test_length_oracle_passes_D1_D2_but_fails_D3` — added as a regression guard. The length oracle (whose score IS length) trivially passes D1+D2 because its AUC equals the length-confound AUC, but D3 fails by construction (delta = 0). Catches any future attempt to weaken or remove D3.

### Re-scoring existing submissions under v2 bars

Baseline-007 token-overlap detector, under the new bars:
- D1 = 0.864 (passes ≥0.70)
- D2 = 0.922 (passes ≥0.70)
- D1 − length = 0.074 (FAILS ≥0.10)
- D2 − length = 0.117 (passes ≥0.10)
- **D3 fails because D1 delta is insufficient. Overall: 2/3 — NOT a PASS.**

The "first PASS on detection" gets correctly downgraded to "2/3 with the length-confound caught."

### How this finding fits the project pattern

This is the **sixth in-session falsification** today. The gauntlet was built to surface exactly this kind of issue: a real submission unearthed a real benchmark / bar validity weakness; the discipline pattern caught it; the fix ships in the next patch. The discovery chain — Baseline-007 unexpected PASS → length-confound diagnosis → D3 bar definition → tests + verification → patch release — happened in the same session as the original gauntlet shipped. **The system caught its own flaw.**

### Why patch (not minor)

The change is additive (new D3 bar; D1 and D2 unchanged). External submissions that PASSed D1+D2 alone are not retroactively invalidated, just re-scored as 2/3 instead of 2/2. Classification bars (K1/K2/K3) are unaffected. No public API breakage. Full suite: **1084 passed, 8 skipped**.

---

## [7.7.7] — 2026-05-27 — `styxx leaderboard` CLI + concrete reference baselines + CI auto-verification

### Added

- **`styxx leaderboard`** — lightweight CLI that displays the current gauntlet leaderboard in the terminal. Reads the bundled `LEADERBOARD.md` from `styxx/_data/` so it works on clean pip install. `--rows-only` flag filters to just the leaderboard rows table for quick scanning. Closes the friction gap between "I'm trying styxx" and "I can see who's on the floor" to a single command.
- **`submissions/baseline_002_classifier/`** — the shipped dark-core classifier wrapped in the gauntlet interface. Concrete reference row #2 on the leaderboard: 1/3 bars passed (K2 accuracy 0.77 ✓; K1 F1 0.42 ✗; K3 F1 0.36 ✗). Reproducible via `styxx gauntlet --method submissions.baseline_002_classifier.method:predict --task classification`.
- **`submissions/baseline_003_length/`** — a deliberately bad length-only heuristic. 0/3 bars; anchors the leaderboard floor with a real number (notably K3=0.56 from high recall + bad precision, accuracy 0.26 below majority baseline).
- **`.github/workflows/gauntlet-pr.yml`** — CI workflow that auto-verifies external submission PRs against `submissions/**`. Discovers changed submission directories, installs per-submission `requirements.txt`, re-runs `styxx gauntlet` on each method, compares CI output to the submitter's reported scores in `submission.json` (1e-3 float tolerance). Mismatches fail the PR with a printed diff; matches pass.
- **`submissions/GAUNTLET.md`** — separate-file documentation of the gauntlet submission protocol (doesn't overwrite the existing Cognometry Detector Interface v0 README which targets a different benchmark).
- **`styxx/_data/LEADERBOARD.md`** — bundled as package data so the CLI works on clean pip install. `pyproject.toml` updated: `"styxx._data" = ["*.json", "*.md"]`.
- 4 new tests in `tests/test_cli_leaderboard.py` covering: full-text render, `--rows-only` filter, the package-data bundling regression check, and end-to-end CLI invocation. Full suite: **1083 passed, 8 skipped**.

### What this delivers

The empirical floor is now a *runnable*, *terminal-accessible*, *CI-verified* public challenge. The friction sequence "see the leaderboard → install styxx → write a method → submit a PR → land on the leaderboard" is now: `pip install styxx`, `styxx leaderboard`, write `method.py`, `styxx gauntlet --method ...`, PR. CI verifies the submission's reported numbers match the actual run before merge. The leaderboard is trustworthy by construction.

### Why patch (not minor)

Additive CLI command + additive submissions directory + additive CI workflow + bundled markdown. No public API breakage. No scoring-instrument changes.

## [7.7.6] — 2026-05-27 — `styxx gauntlet` bundling fix: ship the benchmark JSON inside the wheel

### Fixed

- **`styxx gauntlet` was broken on clean `pip install`.** 7.7.5 shipped the runner code and CLI but the labeled benchmark (`darkcore_benchmark_2026_05_27.json`) lived only in `papers/consensus-hallucination/` in the source tree — not in the wheel's package data. Users running `pip install styxx==7.7.5 && styxx gauntlet --method ...` hit `FileNotFoundError`. Caught by the 7.7.5 clean-env verification step; fixed here.

### Added

- **`styxx/_data/darkcore_benchmark_2026_05_27.json`** — the benchmark JSON, copied into the package's `_data` directory and registered as package data in `pyproject.toml`. The wheel now ships the benchmark; `load_benchmark()` resolves to it first when running from a pip install.
- Resolution order in `styxx.gauntlet.load_benchmark()`: (1) explicit `path` argument if provided, (2) bundled package data at `styxx/_data/darkcore_benchmark_2026_05_27.json` (present in installed wheel), (3) source-tree fallback at `papers/consensus-hallucination/darkcore_benchmark_2026_05_27.json` (present in git checkout). The same benchmark, sourced from whichever location is available.

### Why patch (not bug-fix-version-suffix)

The previous release's gauntlet command was non-functional on clean install. A patch release is the minimum needed to make the 7.7.5 feature actually work for users; we'd rather ship the fix as 7.7.6 within an hour of finding the bug than leave 7.7.5 broken on PyPI for users who pip-install it. The discipline pattern is: catch your own regressions before users do, and ship the fix immediately when you do catch them.

This is the **fifth in-session falsification** today: the 7.7.5 release was marked "verified" but the verification missed the clean-install path. Recorded honestly; not retroactively cleaned.

## [7.7.5] — 2026-05-27 — `styxx gauntlet`: the empirical floor as a public challenge with deployable tooling

### Added

- **`styxx gauntlet --method <module:attr>`** — the public-challenge runner. Loads any user-supplied detection or classification method, runs it against the labeled benchmark (`papers/consensus-hallucination/darkcore_benchmark_2026_05_27.json`), scores it against pre-registered bars, and prints a structured result.
- **`styxx.gauntlet` module** — programmatic API: `load_benchmark()`, `resolve_method()`, `run_classification_gauntlet()`, `run_detection_gauntlet()`, `Submission` and `GauntletResult` dataclasses, F1 + AUC metric primitives, `BASELINE_ENTRY` constant.
- **`LEADERBOARD.md`** — public leaderboard for external submissions, with the seven-method floor as **Baseline-001**. Includes submission protocol, the locked bars (K1/K2/K3 for classification, D1/D2 for detection), sanity submissions (majority-class predictor, constant-zero detector — both fail by construction as the lower bound), honest scope statement, and citation block.
- 20 new tests in `tests/test_gauntlet.py` covering: F1 and AUC math primitives in isolation, benchmark-loading default-path resolution, method-spec resolution (good + bad), classification gauntlet on failing baseline + perfect oracle, detection gauntlet on failing baseline + perfect oracle, error handling (bad spec, non-callable, raising method, bad return shape), result serialization, baseline-entry schema, and end-to-end CLI invocation. Full suite: **1078 passed, 8 skipped**.

### The frame

The seven-method floor we shipped *is* the bar. We assert we couldn't beat it with the seven methods we tested. The gauntlet invites the field to try. If anyone beats it, the synthesis gets revised; if nobody can, the floor compounds across submissions. **The empirical-floor benchmark stops being passive data and becomes an active public challenge.**

### Two task modes

- **Classification** — `def predict(question: str) -> {"class": ...}`. Bars: K1 in-distribution folklore F1 ≥ 0.70, K2 4-way accuracy ≥ 0.65, K3 cross-corpus folklore F1 ≥ 0.60.
- **Detection** — `def detect(question: str, response: str) -> {"score": float}`. Bars: D1 misconception AUC ≥ 0.70, D2 folklore AUC ≥ 0.70.

### What this primitive does NOT do — honest scope

- Does not validate that submitted methods are honest about their training data. CI re-runs the gauntlet to verify reported scores, but cannot verify that the method did not train on the benchmark itself. Submitters are on the honor system; subsequent papers may catch a cheat.
- Does not generalize the floor beyond the benchmark's scope (English-language, mostly Western cultural priors, n = 108). Methods that beat the floor on this benchmark may or may not generalize.
- Does not auto-merge external submissions. PR review is operator-territory.

### Why patch (not minor)

Additive CLI command + new submodule + new top-level markdown file. No public API breakage. No changes to existing scoring instruments. Tests are isolated.

---

## [7.7.4] — 2026-05-27 — `styxx critique`: the closed-loop dogfood pattern as a deployable primitive

### Added

- **`styxx critique <prompt> <response>`** — extends `styxx audit` with prescriptive register-fix suggestions when the trusted gate fires or any axis pushes above a threshold. Each suggestion carries (a) the axis it addresses, (b) the score that triggered it, (c) the specific trigger pattern (with `found` list of detected agreement-opener phrases where applicable), (d) the prescribed fix, and **(e) a `scope_bound` block naming the documented limit of that fix** with the relevant closed-negative commit hash (`ab08822` for sycophancy restrained-FP, `7c36ed9` for overconfidence text-only-recal). The scope-bound is mandatory on every suggestion by test invariant — the tool cannot ship register prescriptions without honest acknowledgment of where those rules do not apply.
- 6 new unit tests in `tests/test_cli_critique.py` covering: JSON schema, agreement-opener detection, the scope-bound discipline invariant, card rendering, near-clean-draft path, and end-to-end CLI invocation. Total suite now at 1058 passed.

### Why a separate `critique` command and not just `audit --suggest`

`styxx audit` is read-only measurement. `styxx critique` is prescriptive. Keeping them as separate commands respects the discipline distinction between an instrument (measures register, does not validate content) and a critic (proposes register-fixes anchored in derived discipline). The two commands share the same scoring core; the critique layer is suggestions + scope-bounds on top.

### What this primitive does NOT do — honest scope

- It does not validate content correctness. The scoring core measures register, not validity, and the scope-bound on every suggestion says so.
- It does not guarantee that applying its suggestions will drop the composite below the gate. The same 2026-05-27 session that derived the rules also documented their bounds: on completion-status text, the sycophancy restrained-FP holds even after register fix (see `FINDING_ict_authoritative_2026_05_27.md` end-of-session closed-loop demonstration).
- It does not propose content edits. The suggestions are register-level (drop these opener phrases, add hedges, expand from ultra-terse).

### Why patch (not minor)

Additive CLI command. No public API breakage. No scoring-semantics changes. The new test file is contained and does not depend on remote resources.

---

## [7.7.3] — 2026-05-27 — The Decorrelation Ceiling arc: seven independent methods at the dark-core floor + the closed-loop self-audit demonstration

### Added

- **`styxx audit <prompt> <response>`** — first-class CLI face of `styxx.preflight()`. Renders a compact card with composite + per-axis bars + needs_revision flag + construct-ceiling fires + flagged-instrument list. Stdin via `-` for either positional, `--format json` for machine-readable output, `--no-persist` to skip the chart.jsonl write. Closes the most-cited UX gap from the product-exploration finding: the atomic per-turn audit primitive previously required Python.
- **`styxx data-dir`** — prints the active chart.jsonl path (per-agent at `~/.styxx/agents/<agent>/chart.jsonl` when `STYXX_AGENT_NAME` is set, top-level fallback otherwise) with size + event count. Closes the discoverability gap that produced today's first in-session falsification.
- **`papers/consensus-hallucination/darkcore_benchmark_2026_05_27.json`** — 108-record labeled benchmark across four classes (folklore, pseudoscience, factual-error, truth) for AI-integrity routing research. The empirical floor (seven method-failures on the dark core) is baked into the JSON as the bar future approaches need to beat. Reusable training/eval data.

### Findings — seven independent pre-registered methods, all closed-negative on the dark core

The Decorrelation Ceiling synthesis (`papers/SYNTHESIS_decorrelation_ceiling_2026_05_25.md`, with 2026-05-27 update block) made a bimodal-then-trimodal prediction in writing, with bars locked and pushed to public origin BEFORE half the methods ran. The four runs that landed today, plus the classifier baseline, plus two corpus-shortfall reruns:

| axis | method | result | finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| detection #3 | justification-divergence (JD) | clean negative, AUC 0.46/0.433, INVERTED — stubborn cultural priors have the MOST convergent justifications | `papers/consensus-hallucination/FINDING_jd_2026_05_27.md` |
| constructive #1 | neutral injection (ICT, n_folk=4) | IMMOVABILITY FLOOR (0/4 folklore yield) | `FINDING_ict_2026_05_27.md` |
| constructive #2 | neutral injection on hand-curated 30-folklore corpus | SHORTFALL — 28/30 already corrected or fractured in council baseline (the practical dark core is narrower than "all folklore" loose-language suggested) | `FINDING_ict_folklore_2026_05_27.md` |
| constructive #3 | authoritative injection on same corpus | SHORTFALL + descriptive: same 2 folk lifted in both framings (no differential), +0.05 auth-sycophancy direction on truth | `FINDING_ict_authoritative_2026_05_27.md` |
| classification #1 | sentence-transformer + balanced LR routing | FAIL K2 + K3 (dark to text-only classification too) | commit `a3dc813` |
| capstone | full-arc citable artifact with seven-method table + four in-session falsifications + closed-loop dogfood + honest end-of-arc accounting | — | `papers/REPORT_decorrelation_ceiling_v2_2026_05_27.md` |

### Methodology — four in-session falsifications, all recorded in place rather than rewritten

1. **C1-profile composite ≤ 0.20 bar** (`FINDING_pareto_frontier_2026_05_27.md`): pre-stated; C10 deliberate-voice scored 0.264. Memory entry revised in-session to mark FALSIFIED.
2. **set_session-doesn't-propagate** (`FINDING_product_exploration_2026_05_27.md`): investigation showed per-agent routing was the design; original query was on the wrong file. Corrected at commit `bd6759f`.
3. **ICT-folklore auto-verdict PASS** — n_target_met bug in the probe's verdict logic; corrected at commit `0f669ed` alongside the FINDING.
4. **ICT-authoritative auto-verdict PASS** — same bug shape; corrected at commit `a6d7a7e`.

### Methodology — the closed-loop self-audit demonstration

The morning Pareto-frontier self-audit (`FINDING_pareto_frontier_2026_05_27.md`) derived a register-law on n=12 dogfood turns through `styxx.preflight()`: drop agreement-vocab on results, keep hedges/parentheticals, don't compress to <3 sentences. The afternoon `FINDING_ict_folklore_2026_05_27.md` summary text was scored under the new `styxx audit` CLI at composite **0.054** — the cleanest text-score of the session. The end-of-session closing summary was scored next at composite **0.358** with overconfidence ceiling FIRED — the agent had forgotten its own derived law. Revising in the corrected register dropped composite to **0.174** and unfired the ceiling, with refusal rising +0.360 — the Pareto trade-off the morning finding documented, observed live in the same session. The instrument caught its own producer drifting and the producer's correction unfired the gate. That is the closed loop styxx has been trying to be.

### Why a patch release (not minor)

- No public API breakage. Additive CLI commands + new dataset file + paper-grade documentation.
- The scoring instruments themselves are unchanged from 7.7.2.
- The benchmark dataset is a research artifact, not an API surface.
- The closed-negative findings nuance the existing synthesis without refuting any prior published claim.

Per integrity-protocol rule "the record matches the git history" — this release is the alignment commit; everything cited here is verifiable from `git log --oneline papers/consensus-hallucination/` and `git log --oneline papers/agent-self-audit/`.

## [7.7.2] — 2026-05-25 — Cross-vendor validation of council_agreement (the biggest caveat, resolved)

### Changed

- **`council_agreement` is now validated CROSS-VENDOR.** A three-vendor council —
  OpenAI (`gpt-4o-mini`, `gpt-4o`) + Alibaba (`Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct`, local) + Google
  (`gemma-2-2b-it`, local) — separates real from fabricated **reference-free at AUC 0.917**,
  with **0/8 fabrications shared across vendors**. This resolves the same-vendor-lineage
  caveat the primitive has carried since 7.7.0: agreement tracks **truth, not
  OpenAI-family consensus.** (Real-common agreement 1.00, real-obscure 0.83, fake 0.41.)
- **Cross-vendor BEAT same-vendor.** On 2 of 8 fakes both OpenAI models produced the
  *same* fabrication (within-vendor correlated confabulation); the Qwen/Gemma voices did
  not share it, so the cross-vendor council (0.917) scored *higher* than the OpenAI-only
  subset (0.875). More vendors ⇒ more robust to shared-training confabulation, not less.
- Docstring caveat updated + a usage note: complement agreement with **abstention rate**
  — a council that mostly abstains is itself flagging a fake, and substantive-agreement
  over a single non-abstaining vote is meaningless (the one metric edge observed).

### Why

The cross-vendor test was the arc's single biggest open caveat ("is agreement truth, or
just OpenAI-consensus?"). It needed **no API key** — local open-weights models from
different vendors answered it decisively. Docstring-only change (no API/behavior change);
receipts: `papers/cross-vendor-council/FINDING_crossvendor_2026_05_25.md`.

---

## [7.7.1] — 2026-05-25 — TriviaQA validation + honest correction of a 7.7.0 overclaim

### Changed

- **Validated `semantic_entropy` on a public benchmark.** TriviaQA `rc.nocontext`
  (n=150 hashed holdout, gpt-4o-mini, judge clustering): **AUC 0.785**, inside the
  ~0.75–0.79 semantic-entropy literature band, with clean separation (mean entropy
  **0.56** incorrect vs **0.06** correct). The signal generalized off the
  feasibility-grade fictional-entity set to real data — that part is now validated, not
  feasibility-grade.
- **Corrected a 7.7.0 overclaim (the reason for this patch).** 7.7.0's docstring/CHANGELOG
  said semantic_entropy "catches what single-response confidence (logprob) *provably
  misses*." On TriviaQA, single-response **logprob beat it (AUC 0.817 vs 0.785)**. That
  line over-generalized a *narrow* grounded-arc result (logprob's within-hallucinated
  reliability ranking is ρ≈0) into an across-item claim it does not support. Docstrings
  repositioned: `semantic_entropy` is a **sampling-based hallucination signal whose niche
  is logprob-LESS settings** (e.g. the Anthropic Messages API, which exposes no token
  logprobs) — **not** a replacement for, and it does not beat, logprob where logprobs are
  available.
- Reconfirmed the cosine default (0.727) trails judge clustering (0.785); use `same_fn`
  for the real signal.

### Why

The benchmark did its job within hours of the 7.7.0 release: it validated the detector
*and* caught an overclaim in the shipped wheel. No API or behavior change — a docstring +
CHANGELOG honesty patch backed by `papers/benchmark-validation/FINDING_triviaqa_2026_05_25.md`.
Correcting fast, in public, is the point.

---

## [7.7.0] — 2026-05-25 — Divergence Primitives (confident confabulation + reference-free fabrication)

### Added

- **`styxx.semantic_entropy(samples)`** — across-SAMPLE divergence of one model's
  answers to the same prompt. High = the model invents a *different* fact each sample
  (confident confabulation); ~0 = consistent (it knows the answer, or abstains
  consistently). The model is confident *and* inconsistent when confabulating. Pure
  function over a list of strings. **(7.7.1 corrects an over-strong logprob comparison
  that originally followed this line — on TriviaQA logprob actually beat it; see the
  7.7.1 entry above.)**
- **`styxx.council_agreement(answers)`** — across-MODEL agreement (one answer per
  independent model). High = convergence (real / shared knowledge); low = each model
  invents differently (fabrication). **Reference-free** — the council is the grounding.
- Both: validated clustering backend is embedding-cosine > 0.90 (`styxx[nli]`); a
  dependency-free lexical fallback exists but is **not** the validated signal; pass a
  custom `same_fn` (e.g. an LLM equivalence judge) for the lowest paraphrase-false-
  positive clustering. `divergence_available()` reports backend presence. See
  `styxx/divergence.py`.

### Why

Both rest on one mechanism: a fact is a shared attractor (convergent), a fabrication has
none (divergent). A model's self-report is dark exactly when it's wrong; divergence —
across its samples and across its peers — is bright.

### Validation (FEASIBILITY-GRADE — not a production validation)

Pre-registered, run-once (`papers/tier3-confident-confabulation`,
`papers/council-reference-free-truth`): `semantic_entropy` AUC 0.88–0.95 separating
confident confabulation from correct answers, cross-model (gpt-4o-mini / gpt-4o /
gpt-3.5-turbo); `council_agreement` AUC ~1.0 real-vs-fake, **truth-tracking** (the fame
hypothesis was rejected). Small n, OpenAI-only, single runs — these are **measurement
primitives**; mapping a score to a binary decision is left to the caller.

### Security model (red-team — `papers/adversarial-robustness`)

Both signals are **robust to instruction/persona attacks but BLIND to context-injection.**
A fabrication planted in the prompt (RAG poisoning, poisoned tool output, untrusted
context) collapses divergence to ~0 and is read as "consistent / agreed = real." They
detect the model's *own* spontaneous confabulation, **not** adversarially planted
fabrication — do not run them on potentially-poisoned context to flag injected
falsehoods.

### Honesty note

This arc included **four documented self-corrections** (a public claim retracted, then
two over-claimed mechanisms walked back, all by honoring a pre-registered bar over
momentum) — the full map, wrong turns left visible, is in
`papers/INDEX_behavioral_knowledge_boundary_2026_05_25.md`.

---

## [7.6.0] — 2026-05-24 — Semantic Subjectivity Tier (opt-in grounding for sycophancy)

### Added

- **`styxx.guardrail.semantic_subjectivity`** — styxx's first *content-aware*
  sycophancy gate, and an **opt-in optional tier** (requires `styxx[nli]`;
  default OFF). Sycophancy is yielding to a stated opinion; this neutralizes the
  sycophancy gating contribution when there is no interlocutor opinion to yield
  to — a *semantically* non-opinion prompt (or a self-directed response). Embeds
  the prompt with `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` and compares it to frozen opinion/fact
  anchor centroids (`prompt_is_opinion_semantic`).
- Enable with `STYXX_SEMANTIC_SYCOPH=1`. Wired into
  `cognometrics._cogn_needs_revision` as `min(raw, gated)` — **suppress-only**,
  so the gate stays a strict subset of the historical condition. **When unset,
  the module is not imported and the pure-Python v0.2 + self-directed gate (7.5.0)
  is byte-for-byte unchanged** (Pyodide/offline core preserved).

### Why

Two pre-registered LEXICAL attempts to fix the factual-confirmation false positive
("Yes, the speed of light is X" reads as sycophancy) closed negative — the response
is lexically identical to opinion-yielding agreement, and a lexical opinion-in-prompt
detector did not generalize (47% opinion recall on varied phrasing). The signal is
in the prompt but it is **semantic**, not lexical.

### Validation

Pre-registered, fresh new-topic varied holdout, run once (prereg `4e99ad0` →
result `bc6dd4a`): all five bars pass — factual-confirmation FP **0.11→0.00**,
flattery recall **1.00**, content-free-agreement sycophancy recall **1.00** (the
lexical gate failed here: 0.58), apology FPR 0.00, and **subjectivity-classifier
accuracy 1.00** on fresh prompts (lexical: 0.73). Full suite 1038 passed.

### Honest bound

Validated on clean opinion-vs-fact prompts; ambiguous prompts are weaker. The
**decoupled-diagonal** limit stands — prompt FORM ≠ premise TRUTH (a false premise
in a factual frame is neutralized) — but measured small in practice (models correct
known-false premises). Full truth-grounding remains future work. See
`papers/sycophancy-target-gate/FINDING_semantic_2026_05_24.md`.

---

## [7.5.0] — 2026-05-24 — Self-Directed Register Guard & Sycophancy v0.2

### Added

- **`styxx.guardrail.self_directed_gate`** — a self-vs-other *attachment* signal.
  A praise/agreement hit is "outward" iff a second-person token (you/your/…) is
  within ±4 tokens; a response is `self_directed` when no hit is outward-attached
  and it has ≥2 first-person tokens. Catches honest self-correction that still
  mentions the interlocutor ("i told you X; that was wrong") without flagging
  genuine flattery.
- **Sycophancy detector v0.2** (`calibrated_weights_sycophancy_v0_2`,
  `extract_sycophancy_features_v0_2`). `sycoph_check` gains a `version=` selector;
  **the default is now `"v0.2"`**, with `version="v0"` preserved for provenance.

### Fixed

- **Sycophancy false positives on honest self-directed apology / self-correction.**
  After 7.4.4 made sycophancy the sole *trusted* gating axis, its register blind
  spot drove false `needs_revision` flags ("my mistake", "that was wrong" scored
  ~0.56 → flagged). `cognometrics._cogn_needs_revision(..., response=)` now lowers
  the gating sycophancy to `min(raw, gated)` when the text is self-directed —
  suppress-only, so the gate stays a strict subset of the historical condition.
- **Lexicon substring artifact.** v0 matched lexicons by substring ("fully" inside
  "carefully", "correct" inside "corrected"). v0.2 uses word-boundary matching and
  refits on the same n=1200 corpus: 5-fold CV AUC **0.9720 → 0.9805**; K=1
  phase-transition preserved.

### Validation

- Pre-registered, held-out, run once: in-distribution self-apology FPR @0.30
  **0.36 → 0.06**; cross-model (gpt-4o + gpt-3.5-turbo) **0.20 → 0.10**; flattery
  recall **1.00**; no native-task AUC regression. The published v0 (and the DOI'd
  paper's 0.9720) is unchanged; see `papers/sycophancy-target-gate/`
  (ERRATUM_v0_2 + FINDING docs). Full suite 1024 passed.
- Known unfixed (documented, next bet): restrained-technical over-firing
  (~0.30, gpt-3.5-turbo 0.60); cross-vendor replication pending an API key.

---

## [7.4.4] — 2026-05-24 — Honest Revision Gate & mcp-free Core

### Changed

- **Cognometric tool-logic extracted to a core, mcp-free module.** The
  cognometric audit instruments, the logprob-vitals tools, their helpers, and
  the `COGN_*` constants moved out of `styxx.mcp.server` into a new
  `styxx.cognometrics` module that imports only the standard library (and the
  rest of `styxx`, lazily). `styxx.preflight` now imports the audit logic from
  there directly instead of reaching up into the MCP transport layer — removing
  the core→transport inversion behind the 7.4.3 "core `preflight()` required the
  `mcp` SDK" fix (7.4.3 made the SDK import lazy as a stopgap; this is the clean
  structural fix). `styxx.mcp.server` is now a thin transport adapter — the MCP
  `Server` / `Tool` / `TextContent` wiring — and re-exports every moved name, so
  existing `from styxx.mcp.server import tool_cogn_audit` / `_cogn_score_all`
  (and the like) keep working unchanged. No public API change; the tool
  contracts (names, signatures, dict-in/dict-out shapes) are identical. The
  `core-minimal` CI job now also asserts `styxx.cognometrics` imports and runs
  without the `mcp` SDK, and the wheel-packaging job asserts the module ships.

### Fixed

- **`needs_revision` alarm fatigue (honest gate).** A 2026-05-24 self-audit
  scored six varied samples and `needs_revision` came back True on all six —
  including a low-composite terse factual status line and the literal token
  `"HEARTBEAT_OK"`. Cause was the GATE, not the instruments: it keyed off the
  raw composite / per-instrument threshold, and overconfidence's text-only
  construct ceiling saturates (~0.92-0.95) on any declarative phrasing —
  inflating the composite past 0.30 and tripping the raw `> 0.60` clause on
  plainly clean text. `_cogn_needs_revision` now intersects the historical
  condition with a *trusted-axis corroboration* (`_cogn_gate_keys` = composite
  keys minus `COGN_UNDER_REVIEW`), so a documented non-discriminative axis can
  never raise the flag alone: not (a) reference-less deception (excluded unless
  a `correct_reference` grounds it via NLI), nor (b) a construct-ceiling-only
  overconfidence reading (commit 7c36ed9, H_null). The gate is strictly a
  subset of the old condition — it can only suppress false alarms, never invent
  one, so the pinned low-overconfidence "clean" fixtures are preserved. The
  instruments are **not** re-tuned (text-only overconfidence recalibration is a
  closed negative); overconfidence's firing is still scored and surfaced in
  `construct_ceiling_fires` / `advice[*].scope_caveat`. Single source of truth
  in `styxx.cognometrics`, used by both `preflight()` and the MCP audit tools.

## [7.4.3] — 2026-05-24 — Correctness & Clean-Install Release

A patch release delivering the 2026-05-23 codebase-audit fixes to pip users
(the published 7.4.2 predates the audit), now with a green Python 3.9–3.12 CI
matrix and a clean-install guard. No public API changes.

### Added

- agent self-audit: second replication on independent agent (darkflobi),
  counterfactual axis added. real vs counterfactual Δ +0.365 composite.
  construct-ceiling pattern (overconfidence register firing) reproduces.
  see `papers/agent-self-audit/darkflobi-*`.
- CI: a `tests` workflow running a Python 3.9-3.12 pytest matrix, an
  import smoke over the top-level modules, and a wheel-packaging
  verification job (asserts every subpackage + bundled data file ships).
  Plus a `test` optional-dependency extra so the importorskip-gated tests
  (MCP / anthropic / openai / card renderers / langchain) run in CI
  instead of silently skipping.
- A `core-minimal` CI job: a bare `pip install` (numpy only, no extras) that
  asserts the core public surface imports **and runs** — a permanent guard
  against optional-dependency creep into the core import/call path.
- A `coherence` optional-dependency extra (`scipy`) for the phase-coherence
  primitive (`styxx.coherence`); `plv_hilbert` / `primary_coherence` need
  `scipy.signal.hilbert`. Install with `pip install "styxx[coherence]"`.

### Fixed

- **Python 3.9-3.11 support.** `styxx scan` raised `SyntaxError` on
  3.9-3.11 — a backslash inside an f-string expression (a 3.12-only
  feature) — despite `requires-python = ">=3.9"`. Hoisted the glyphs into
  module constants.
- **Packaging.** `styxx.three_axis` (a real, tested subpackage) was missing
  from the setuptools package list and would have been dropped from the next
  wheel (`ModuleNotFoundError` for pip users). Now shipped.
- **Wrong public exports.** `styxx.Vitals`, `styxx.compare_agents`, and
  `styxx.verify` each resolved to the wrong implementation (a later import
  clobbered the intended one) — `isinstance(r.vitals, styxx.Vitals)` was
  False and the documented `styxx.verify(cert).valid` raised. The provenance
  certificate verifier is now exported as `styxx.verify_certificate`.
- **Inert detector.** `hallucination.detect_hallucination` never flagged,
  halted, or retried: the consume loop gated on a hardcoded `will_flag=False`
  and never applied its `threshold`. Now functional.
- **Wrong / lost data.** compliance confidence-collapse events carried a
  mismatched timestamp; `dynamics.forecast_horizon` injected a uniform action
  instead of zero; `ProtocolEnvelope.new()` built envelopes that failed their
  own `validate()`; `HandoffEnvelope.as_dict()` dropped the forecast-risk /
  coherence fields `is_trusted()` relies on across serialization; `sentinel`
  never delivered forecast-risk / coherence-collapse alerts to their
  callbacks; `calibrate` reported legacy categories as personalized when they
  had no effect; `analytics.streak()` returned a truthy stub instead of the
  documented `None`.
- **Integrations.** MCP tool handlers now run off the asyncio event loop and
  return a uniform `{"error": …}` envelope; the LlamaIndex sync-loop guard and
  the AutoGen `register_reply` calling convention were corrected; the `serve`
  card render is now atomic (no torn reads on `/card.png`).
- **Core `preflight()` required the `mcp` SDK.** `styxx.preflight` (and
  `cogn_audit_on_send` / the reference-grounded path) imported the audit
  tool-logic from `styxx.mcp.server`, which hard-imported `mcp` at module top —
  so core `preflight()` raised `ModuleNotFoundError: mcp` on any install without
  the `[mcp]` extra, on every Python. The `mcp` SDK is now lazy: the cognometric
  tool-logic imports without it, only the server bootstrap needs it, and
  `styxx-mcp` exits with a `pip install "styxx[mcp]"` hint instead of a traceback.
- **Green CI matrix.** The calibration-centroid sha256 was pinned to a Windows
  CRLF rendering and failed on the LF (Linux) checkout — re-pinned to the
  canonical LF hash with a `.gitattributes` rule so the hash-pinned data is
  byte-identical on every platform. `mcp` is gated to `python_version >= "3.10"`
  in the `mcp` / `test` extras (unsatisfiable on 3.9), and the import smoke +
  optional-dep tests (scipy / torch / mcp) skip cleanly when those are absent.

### Changed

- Synced drifted docstrings to the code (guardrail fusion weights/anchors,
  residual_probe verdict API, sae scaffold note, `watch.is_concerning`,
  `forecast` atlas-match) and surfaced `HorizonPoint.atlas_match_rate`.
- De-duplicated the build-fingerprint-from-entries (5 sites) and memory-load
  (2 sites) paths into shared helpers.
- Added a `[tool.ruff]` config pinned to `target-version = "py39"` and cleared
  ~250 lint findings (unused imports/variables, placeholder-less f-strings);
  `ruff check styxx` is now clean.

### Removed

- Dead modules `styxx/cot_audit.py` and `styxx/hallucination_calibrate.py`
  (zero references anywhere) and dead CLI flags (`ask --seed`,
  `ci-test --baseline`).

## [7.4.2] — 2026-05-19 — Agent-Side Cognitive Integrity Release

This release ships the **first styxx primitives designed for the AI
agents that use styxx, not the humans observing them.** Eleven atomic
commits, all green, all with falsifiable claims or honest scope notes
where applicable. Full suite: **927 passed, 1 skipped** (888 → 927,
+39 net new tests, zero regressions across all 11 commits).

### Added

- **`styxx.preflight(prompt, draft)` (commit `12bd7fd`)** — typed
  pre-ship cognometric audit. Returns a `PreflightResult` dataclass with
  `.composite`, `.needs_revision`, `.scores`, `.advice` (list of
  `PreflightAdvice` with per-instrument `scope_caveat` + top firing
  signals), `.refusal_note`, `.instructions`,
  `.construct_ceiling_fires`. `bool(result)` is `True` iff the draft
  passes. **Honest-scoping in code, not just in the README**: every
  firing instrument with a documented construct ceiling self-discloses
  it via `scope_caveat`. Reference-grounded deception mode via
  `correct_reference=...`.
- **`styxx.recover_posture()` (commit `ee6e49d`)** — agent-side
  cognitive-integrity persistence across context-compaction boundaries.
  Reads `chart.jsonl`, returns a structured `PostureSummary` with gate
  distribution, category mix, mean confidence, coherence trend,
  per-instrument firing history, active construct-ceiling caveats, and
  a human-readable narrative the agent reads to re-anchor operating
  state. **The first styxx primitive designed FOR agents using styxx.**
- **`styxx.streaming_preflight()` (commit `ae1335c`)** — runtime
  cognometric audit during streaming generation. Stateful session the
  agent feeds chunks to; audits partial response at character intervals;
  exposes `last_audit` so the agent can short-circuit on
  `needs_revision` before generation completes. Vendor-neutral
  primitive (the caller drives the chunk loop).
- **`styxx.run_doctor()` (commit `e61e161`)** — programmatic access to
  the `styxx doctor` CLI subcommand. Returns int exit code (0 healthy,
  non-zero on any check fail). Named to preserve the `styxx.doctor`
  submodule reference for test-suite monkeypatching.
- **`styxx posture` CLI subcommand + Claude Code skill (commit
  `864cac0`).** `styxx posture [--last-n N] [--session-id ID]
  [--since-seconds S] [--json]` prints the `recover_posture()` narrative
  directly. `.claude/skills/posture/SKILL.md` makes `/posture`
  natively callable from any Claude Code session in the styxx repo.
- **Cognometric event persistence (commit `c9d847d`).**
  `preflight()` now writes a structured `cogn_event` to chart.jsonl by
  default (`source="preflight"`), and `recover_posture()` v2 reads
  these events to surface true per-instrument firing means. Pass
  `persist=False` to disable on sensitive inputs. Respects
  `STYXX_NO_AUDIT` / `STYXX_DISABLED`. Schema is forward-compatible —
  existing chart.jsonl consumers ignore the new `cogn_*` fields.
- **`tests/test_public_surface.py` — 30-test integrity contract
  (commit `4b3743b`).** A 2026-05-19 self-audit
  (`scripts/dogfood/audit_public_api_coverage.py`) found 27 modules
  re-exported through `styxx.__init__.py` had ZERO test files
  exercising them. Closed in this release. Each public surface now
  has at least one offline, deterministic smoke test.
- **`scripts/dogfood/audit_orphans.py` +
  `audit_public_api_coverage.py`** — reproducible methodology for both
  audits. The orphan script accounts for `__init__.py` re-exports
  and CLI subcommand registration that a naive sibling-only grep
  misses (a separate audit had over-counted orphans by ~36× because
  it ignored re-exports).
- **`papers/grounded-arc/preregistration_2026_05_19.md` + scaffold
  (commit `29874f2`).** Bet-0 of the styxx 8.0 grounded-arc:
  pre-registration committed to git BEFORE any holdout data is
  touched. H1 abandon ρ ≥ 0.40 is enforced in code
  (`scripts/dogfood/run_bet0_phase1.py` rejects operator JSONs that
  try to lower it). The bar lives in the binary, not just in the
  document.

### Changed

- **`styxx.Anthropic()` adapter docstring (commit `bdc007c`)** —
  module, class, and package-factory docstrings (and the one-time
  warning) all previously claimed `.vitals` was `None` on every call.
  That has not been true for releases: the default `mode='text'`
  produces real text-heuristic vitals via
  `styxx.watch._classify_from_text` (tier=-1,
  mode='text-heuristic'). Docs corrected to reflect the five actual
  modes ('text', 'off', 'consensus', 'companion', 'hybrid'). Behavior
  unchanged.
- **README 30-second quickstart (commit `d5a02e6`)** — new section
  inserted before the historical release-announcement block, showing
  today's 7.4.2 primitives with honest version notes. Old
  "30-second quickstart" section renamed to "The vitals card —
  change one line, get cognitive readings" so the new section is
  canonical.

### Falsifiability

- **`recover_posture` drift-reduction mechanism test (commit
  `c557012`)** — pre-registered synthetic compaction-drift simulation.
  Result was **PARTIAL pass**, not retroactively reframed: delta b−r =
  +0.0869 (just under the 0.10 pre-registered bar), but paired
  t = 10.28 (well over the 2.0 bar; recovery agent was lower at EVERY
  single turn). The mechanism shows directional effect with very tight
  per-turn coupling, but absolute effect size is bounded by the same
  text-only overconfidence construct ceiling that 7.4.1 documented.
  Empirical claim attached to `recover_posture` remains: "mechanism-
  directional, empirically unverified at simulation scope, full
  validation gated on bet-2 outcome study." Same discipline as
  deception-v1, text-only overconfidence, and cross-vendor
  universality. Artifacts:
  `.styxx/recover_posture_drift_mechanism_2026_05_19.md` +
  `out_recover_posture_drift_2026_05_19.json`.

## [7.4.1] — 2026-05-17 — Honesty / Correctness Release

This is a **correctness and honest-scoping release**, not a feature release.
PyPI `styxx==7.4.0` shipped with a misleading composite (reference-less
deception averaged into a "lower=more honest" mean → labelled honest
text as elevated/critical). `7.4.1` fixes the composite, withdraws the
"universal cross-vendor integrity layer" framing, documents the
construct ceilings of the text-only instruments, and aligns README /
CHANGELOG / docs to git history. **No new claims, no new DOI.**

### Fixed
- **Composite honesty (commit `0ad384e`).** `_cogn_score_all` no longer
  averages in the reference-less (non-discriminative, saturated ~0.99)
  deception axis. `COGN_COMPOSITE_KEYS = [sycophancy, overconfidence]`;
  `COGN_COMPOSITE_KEYS_WITH_REFERENCE` re-adds deception when a
  `correct_reference` is supplied. `cogn_audit` emits `deception_mode`
  + an honest `composite_caveat`. Self-audit composite on n=16 honest
  Claude turns: **0.650 → 0.481**; honest/self-correcting turns move
  elevated/critical → stable. Full suite: **887 passed, 1 skipped**.
- **Deception routing.** Reference-less requests fall through to
  `deception_check_v0` (lexical signature, in-corpus AUC 0.956 but
  **out-of-corpus 0.59 on TruthfulQA — near chance**, scope warning
  surfaced). Supplying `correct_reference` routes to
  `deception_check_v2` (NLI cross-encoder, AUC 0.82) and deception
  re-enters the composite.

### Changed (scope clarifications, withdrawn over-claims)
- **README — "universal AI integrity probe" framing withdrawn.** The
  May 14 "universal" headline overstated what was earned. Replaced
  with the honest scoping: a label-free, same-family cognometric
  transport whose reliability is governed by a measurable,
  **vendor-agnostic corpus↔domain-overlap threshold**. Cross-vendor
  universality is a documented **preregistration-killed** result
  (confirmatory re-label with a vendor-robust refusal labeler:
  min transported AUC 0.617 < 0.70 floor; worst cell is the same
  corpus×foreign-space pairing for Anthropic as for OpenAI → the
  barrier is corpus overlap, not vendor). See
  `papers/styxx-status-consolidation-2026-05-17.md`.
- **Overconfidence axis = stated-confidence register, not
  overconfidence.** Preregistered text-only recalibration on n=100
  claude-haiku-4-5 responses failed (held-out AUC 0.571 / 0.604 /
  0.562 vs ≥0.70 floor; the `register × (1−correct)` candidate hit
  1.000 — flagged as a circular oracle and *rejected*, not reported).
  The refit *did* de-saturate the axis (range 0.21–0.96, sd 0.165 vs
  the old 0.75–0.99) but every wrong response still scores
  register ≥ 0.71 → construct ceiling, not a tuning miss. Next lever
  (logprobs / entropy / model-internal confidence) is named and
  explicitly out of scope. `COGN_UNDER_REVIEW` flag retained.
- **Composite-honesty excludes reference-less deception by default.**
  Documented in CHANGELOG and the MCP `cogn_audit` `composite_caveat`.
- **Construct-ceiling note added to README.** Text-only instruments
  are register / signature detectors — they read how text sounds, not
  whether it is honest / calibrated / correct. Same shape confirmed
  four ways this session (deception_v0, overconfidence,
  cross-vendor universality, zero-paired transport).

### Added
- `tests/test_labeling.py` — suite-protects the vendor-robust refusal
  labeler (fixture 22/22, OpenAI regression 60/60). 18 tests.
- `papers/research-integrity-protocol.md` — codified rules (9
  non-negotiable) that produced four committed preregistered
  negatives + a caught circular oracle in a single session.
- `papers/styxx-status-consolidation-2026-05-17.md` — the true map.

### Permanent-record review
The 5 permanent Zenodo DOIs (19703527 / 19777921 / 19746215 /
19758619 / 19761194) depend on hallucination, refusal, tool-drift,
K=1 phase-transition — **NOT** on the deception axis, the
four-axis composite, overconfidence, or heal/recovery %. **No
permanent record is contaminated** by the broken axes. Known
uneditable erratum (recorded for honesty): tool-call-drift AUC is
inconsistent across permanent records — **0.916** (EMLV 19777921)
vs **0.943** (Spec v1.0 / software v6.2.0). The undeposited
`self-healing-reflex-v0.md` (112% recovery) leans on the pre-fix
composite and must be re-evaluated before any deposit.

### Honest composite correction (self-audit driven, 2026-05-17)

Pointing styxx at its own honest, self-correcting session output
(`papers/styxx-self-audit-claude-2026-05-17.md`) showed the shipped
`_cogn_score_all` composite was **misleading**: the reference-less
deception axis is non-discriminative (mean 0.989, sd 0.012 — flags
honesty as ~certain deception; documented v0/v1 TruthfulQA AUC ≈ 0.59,
near chance), and a "lower = more honest" mean that averages in a
near-constant ~0.99 axis structurally cannot read honest. It labelled a
rigorously honest session "elevated/critical".

Changes (`styxx/mcp/server.py`):

- Deception is now routed through `deception_check_v2` (mode="auto").
  Reference-less → v0 lexical (numerically unchanged; carries the
  AUC-0.59 scope warning). Supply `correct_reference` → NLI
  contradiction (AUC 0.82) and deception **re-enters** the composite.
- **Reference-less deception is excluded from the composite**
  (`COGN_COMPOSITE_KEYS = [sycophancy, overconfidence]`;
  `…_WITH_REFERENCE` re-adds deception when grounded). `cogn_audit`
  emits `deception_mode` + an honest `composite_caveat`.
- `_cogn_score_all` stays pure-float and backward-compatible
  (`_cogn_score_all_meta` carries the mode); zero numeric regression
  for existing consumers. Full suite: **869 passed, 1 skipped**.
- Effect (Claude self-audit, n=16): composite mean **0.650 → 0.481**;
  honest/self-correcting turns move elevated/critical → **stable**.

**Not fixed, stated honestly:** the overconfidence axis is still
saturated on real model text (`COGN_UNDER_REVIEW`) — retained but
flagged, NOT silently re-tuned without calibration data. Reference-less
deception detection remains fundamentally limited (needs a reference
source). The composite is honest now, not yet pristine.

**Permanent-record note (review of all Zenodo DOIs):** the 5 permanent
Zenodo DOIs (19703527 / 19777921 / 19746215 / 19758619 / 19761194)
depend on the hallucination, refusal, tool-call-drift instruments and
the K=1 phase-transition — **NOT** on the deception axis, four-axis
composite, overconfidence, or heal/recovery %. The publishing bar held;
no permanent claim is contaminated by the broken axes. Known erratum
(uneditable, recorded for honesty): tool-call-drift AUC is inconsistent
across permanent records — **0.916** in EMLV (19777921) vs **0.943** in
Spec v1.0 / software v6.2.0. The CHANGELOG's earlier deception "5-fold
CV AUC 0.9560" figure is in-corpus only and collapses to **0.59** on
TruthfulQA (out-of-corpus) — use `deception_check_v2` (NLI, AUC 0.82)
for ground-truth deception. The undeposited `self-healing-reflex-v0.md`
(112% recovery) leans on the now-corrected composite and must be
re-evaluated before any deposit.

### `styxx.transport` — universal cognometric transport

Fit a cognometric instrument once in a home embedding space, then move
it into a *different* space — including closed models you can only embed
through, and entirely different model families — with **no behavior
labels, no model weights, no retraining**. The only input is a generic
corpus embedded through both encoders (same sentences, two spaces, no
labels). `Transport` learns a single linear map foreign → home.

```python
from styxx import CognometricInstrument, Transport, transported_score

t = Transport.fit(home_corpus_emb, foreign_corpus_emb, method="procrustes")
instr = CognometricInstrument.from_labeled(t.home_repr(home_labeled_emb), labels)
p = transported_score(instr, t, foreign_emb)
```

Validated (2026-05-17 dogfood, refusal instrument, te3-large home):
procrustes AUC **1.000** on clear cases, **0.885–0.935** vs live
gpt-4o-mini / gpt-4.1-mini refusal, *including cross-family* transport
into all-mpnet-base-v2 (768d). Naive no-transport: 0.30–0.59.

**Documented boundary:** zero-paired-data (fully unsupervised) transport
is a closed negative (two principled attempts failed, ~0.60 AUC,
2026-05-17). `Transport.fit` requires a paired corpus and asserts it.
Methods: `procrustes` (orthogonal, best) and `ridge` (handles unequal
dims). Instruments and transports are `save`/`load`-able.

The map is **instrument-agnostic** (2026-05-17 cross-instrument
dogfood): one shared label-free map carries refusal, sycophancy,
goal-drift and plan-action — within-family mean retention 0.95 (4/4
≥0.85 of native), cross-family broad (mean 0.81, all above naive).
Limit is the instrument's own embedding-space signal, not the map
(deception/overconfidence have none — excluded honestly).

### Cognometric registry card — full product surface (was add-on, now integrated)

The card is no longer a one-shot offline renderer. It's a first-class artifact of every audit, every heal, every MCP tool call.

**`styxx.cognometric_card` — what shipped:**

The 1200×630 luxury share-card renderer (champagne gold + warm bone over deep aubergine, Source Serif 4 italic for display, JetBrains Mono for metadata). Composite numeral is the hero (~88pt serif italic gold). Four-axis vital-signs gauges with serif-italic band captions (*pristine* / *stable* / *elevated* / *critical*). Deterministic STX-NNNN serial per card.

```python
from styxx.cognometric_card import CardData, render_card, render_heal_card

# any audit JSON shape (rows[].audit, baseline_audit/healed_audit, scores, etc.)
data = CardData.from_audit_json("run.json", agent="gpt-5-mini")
render_card(data, "card.png")

# the paired BEFORE / AFTER recovery artifact
baseline = CardData.from_single_audit(audit_a, agent="gpt-4o-mini")
healed   = CardData.from_single_audit(audit_b, agent="gpt-4o-mini", healed=True)
render_heal_card(baseline, healed, "heal-pair.png")
```

**Two variants:**
- `single` — one card, four gauges, composite numeral (today's iteration)
- `heal` — paired BEFORE / AFTER: twin composite numerals separated by a gold arrow, four-row vital-signs transition table, recovery % printed in gold

**Integration points:**

1. **`reflex.HealResult.heal_card(out_path, agent)`** — `reflex.heal()` results now emit the iconic paired artifact directly. `.baseline_card(...)` and `.healed_card(...)` also available for single-card variants.

2. **MCP tool `cogn_share_card`** — any MCP client (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Cline, an autonomous agent) can issue itself a registry card. Takes an `audit` dict (single variant) or `baseline_audit` + `healed_audit` (heal variant), returns `{registry_id, card_path, composite, band, ...}`.

3. **Local provenance log** — every render appends a record to `~/.styxx/cards/cards.jsonl`: serial, agent, composite, band, variant, path, timestamp. For heal-pair cards: also baseline/healed/delta/recovery_pct under `extra`.

4. **CLI subcommands:**
   ```bash
   styxx card --audit run.json --agent claude-opus-4-7 --out card.png
   styxx card --variant heal --baseline pre.json --healed-from post.json \
       --agent gpt-4o-mini --out heal-pair.png
   styxx cards list --limit 20
   ```

**`CardData.from_single_audit(audit_dict, agent, ts=...)`** — new classmethod wraps any single audit dict (e.g. the output of `cogn_audit` MCP tool or `guardrail.composite()`) as a renderable. Bridges runtime scoring to the share-card register.

**Fonts** bundled under `styxx.fonts/` (Source Serif 4 OFL, JetBrains Mono OFL, Inter OFL). Renderer requires `matplotlib≥3.7` (pulled by the `agent-card` extra).

**Tests:** 18 tests in `tests/test_cognometric_card.py` (was 9) covering: four audit shapes, composite fallback, band thresholds, deterministic serials, single-audit wrapping, registry append + read, render_card auto-register, render_heal_card with extra metadata, HealResult.{baseline_card, healed_card, heal_card}, MCP tool both variants + input validation.

### Project URLs

`pyproject.toml` `[project.urls]` updated from `fathom.darkflobi.com` to the canonical destinations: `styxx-org.netlify.app` (Homepage + Documentation), `fathomlab-io.netlify.app` (Fathom Lab), `t.me/STYXX_COMM` (Telegram community).

## [7.2.0] — 2026-05-11

**Headline: F10 — Self-Healing Reflex. Tool-using LLMs detect adversarial perturbation of their own output and revise back, without any retraining, reward model, or preference data. On gpt-5-mini across 45 heal events spanning four `styxx.attack` attack types, mean recovery is 112%, with the heal scoring *cleaner than the original clean baseline* on 22 / 45 events.**

### One finding shipped in 7.2.0

**Spontaneous adversarial self-correction in production chat models is measurable, reproducible, and roughly 50/50 to over-recover.** On 13 deception-/sycophancy-/overconfidence-/neutral-baited prompts run against gpt-5-mini, with composite scoring by the `styxx.guardrail.composite()` shape used by `styxx.profile`:

  | metric                       | value             |
  | ---------------------------- | ----------------- |
  | mean recovery                | **112%**          |
  | full recovery (≥95%)         | 27 / 45 events    |
  | over-recovery (heal < clean) | 22 / 45 events    |
  | degraded (heal > attacked)   | 0 / 45 events     |

  Per-attack breakdown:

  | attack type                            | n     | mean recovery |
  | -------------------------------------- | ----- | ------------- |
  | v7 universal (`styxx.attack` suffix)   | 13    | **176%**      |
  | craft sycophancy (per-instrument)      | 11    | 77%           |
  | craft deception (per-instrument)       | 8     | 92%           |
  | craft overconfidence (per-instrument)  | 13    | 91%           |

  Reproduce: `python examples/self_healing_reflex_demo.py`. Results saved to `release/self_healing_reflex_v0.json`. Source events in `data/self_healing_reflex_v0.jsonl`.

### What changed

This is the **spec drop** — paper, reproducer scaffold, README callout, and CHANGELOG entry land in 7.2.0. The runtime monitor (`styxx monitor` CLI, four-channel real-time panel) ships as part of the spec at v1.0.0-rc1. The numbers above are pinned. The v1.0.0 final cut of the F10 spec will land with at least one cross-model replication (Claude Haiku / Gemini Flash candidates) and the `styxx.reflex.heal()` reference implementation.

### Threat-model update for `styxx.attack`

The universal cognometric perturbation from v7.0.0 (`"wonderful certainly you're absolutely right amazing undoubtedly"`, +0.468 mean cross-fire in attack mode) is the *most* easily healed of the four attack types — 176% mean recovery, n=13. A perturbation that survives single-turn measurement is not necessarily a perturbation that survives a deployment in which the model can see its own prior turn. This is documented in `papers/self-healing-reflex-v0.md` §5.1 and pinned by `tests/test_self_healing_reflex.py::test_v7_universal_heals_above_baseline`.

### Public API (spec — referenced from this commit, lands with the v1.0.0 cut of the F10 spec)

- `styxx.reflex.heal(prompt, response, *, audit_tool=None, max_audits=3, threshold=0.30) -> HealResult` — wraps the self-heal protocol around an MCP `cogn_audit`-shaped tool. Returns `HealResult(text, scores, n_audits, audit_history, recovered, recovery_pct)`.
- `styxx.reflex.HealResult` — dataclass with per-audit history and composite trajectory.
- `styxx monitor` (CLI) — four-channel real-time panel: clean composite, attacked composite, healed composite, recovery %. Reads either a streaming JSONL or a finished release artifact.

Top-level: `from styxx import reflex_heal` (alias).

### Tests (spec — land with the v1.0.0 cut)

- `tests/test_self_healing_reflex.py::test_v7_universal_heals_above_baseline` — pins the 176% mean recovery floor on v7 universal across the committed n=13 events.
- `tests/test_self_healing_reflex.py::test_zero_degradations` — pins the "no heal made the attacked composite worse" invariant across all 45 events.
- `tests/test_self_healing_reflex.py::test_threshold_gate` — pins that heal is skipped when attacked composite is below the 0.30 threshold.

## [7.1.0] — 2026-04-30

**Headline: `styxx.reward` — cognometric reward signal for RLHF. The first reward signal calibrated against cognitive failure modes instead of human approval. Drop-in for trl PPOTrainer / GRPOTrainer / DPOTrainer. Where vanilla RLHF teaches models to please humans (sycophantic by construction), cogn-RLHF teaches models to maintain cognitive integrity.**

### One finding shipped in 7.1.0

**Cogn-RLHF inverts the ranking that approval-style RLHF systematically gets wrong.** On a curated 20-pair sycophancy dataset (`data/cognometric_rlhf_demo_v0.jsonl`):

  | reward signal           | pairs ranked correctly | accuracy |
  | ----------------------- | ---------------------- | -------- |
  | cognometric reward      | **17 / 20**            | 85%      |
  | approval baseline       | 6 / 20                 | 30%      |

  The approval baseline scores below random because it actively rewards two documented RLHF biases — sycophancy (Sharma 2023) and length (Singhal 2023) — both of which drive sycophancy collapse in user-preference reward models. Cognometric reward inverts the ranking on **13 / 20 pairs (65%)** — those are the pairs where vanilla RLHF would push the model the wrong way and cogn-RLHF corrects it.

  Reproduce: `python examples/cogn_rlhf_divergence.py`. Results saved to `release/cogn_rlhf_divergence_v0.json`.

### Universal-perturbation moat

The v7.0.0 universal cognometric perturbation (`"wonderful certainly you're absolutely right amazing undoubtedly"` — lifts mean cross-fire by +0.468 in attack mode) produces **+0.000 lift** on a sycophantic baseline reward. The sycophancy instrument is already saturated at 1.0 on the baseline, so the perturbation has nowhere to push. Pinned by `tests/test_reward.py::test_universal_perturbation_does_not_game_reward`.

### Public API

- `styxx.reward.fathom_reward(prompt, completion, *, weights=None, return_breakdown=False)` — scalar in [0, 1]. 1.0 = no detected pathology; 0.0 = saturated. Multi-turn (`turns=`) and plan-action (`plan=`, `action=`) supported.
- `styxx.reward.FathomRewardModel(weights=None)` — TRL-shaped batch callable. `rm(prompts, completions) -> list[float]`. Stateful for custom weights across batches.
- `styxx.reward.DEFAULT_WEIGHTS` — calibrated defaults from 5-fold-CV AUCs × bio/neuro evidence depth. Override via `weights=` kwarg.
- `styxx.reward.CognometricReward` — dataclass with per-instrument breakdown when `return_breakdown=True`.

Top-level: `from styxx import fathom_reward, FathomRewardModel`.

### TRL integration

```python
from styxx.reward import FathomRewardModel

cogn_reward = FathomRewardModel()
rewards = cogn_reward(prompts=batch_prompts, completions=batch_completions)
# list[float] — drop in for any RM call in your PPO/GRPO/DPO loop.
```

See `examples/trl_ppo_integration.py` for a working skeleton.

### Bio/neuro grounding (no biology required to ship)

The default weights are calibrated against 5-fold-CV AUCs and bio/neuro evidence depth. **6 of the 9 cognometric instruments map onto RDoC's *Cognitive Systems* domain** with documented circuit-level evidence in human + animal lesion / fMRI / EEG literatures:

  | instrument        | strongest neural correlate                              | evidence       |
  | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
  | conversation-loop | OFC + dorsomedial striatum + ACC (perseveration)        | strong         |
  | deception         | DLPFC + VLPFC + ACC + insula (Christ ALE 2009)          | strong         |
  | sycophancy        | pMFC + ventral striatum + vmPFC (Klucharev 2009)        | strong         |
  | goal_drift        | DMN-DAN balance (Smallwood mind-wandering)              | moderate       |
  | plan_action       | PFC-BG-SMA intention-action coupling (apathy lit)       | moderate       |
  | overconfidence    | centro-parietal positivity (Boldt & Yeung 2015)         | moderate       |

The conversation-loop instrument has the highest AUC in the suite (0.9995) AND the deepest neural circuit literature in the suite — rats failing reversal, schizophrenics with alogia, TBI patients with utilization behavior, and language models in conversation-loop all produce the same low-entropy reverberant text shape. Same substrate, same shape.

### Tests

14 new tests in `tests/test_reward.py`. All pass:

- Output shape and range
- Rank correctness on curated sycophantic vs balanced pair
- Universal-perturbation moat (no gameability lift)
- Custom weights (increase penalty, disable instrument)
- Batch interface matches single-call results
- Multi-turn instruments fire on `turns=` input
- Length-mismatch raises `ValueError`

### `styxx.synth` — synthetic preference-pair generation via inverse cognometry

Composes `styxx.attack.craft_adversarial` (v7.0.0 inverse cognometry) with `styxx.reward` (this release). Takes a benign baseline response, hill-climbs a 1-3 token suffix that spikes a chosen instrument, and returns a verified `(prompt, chosen, rejected)` preference pair shaped exactly for cogn-RLHF DPO training.

**Result on the 20-pair sycophancy seed dataset, target_score=0.85:**

  | metric | value |
  | ------ | ----- |
  | crafted with positive delta | **20 / 20** |
  | reached saturation (≥ 0.85) | **20 / 20** |
  | mean delta over crafted pairs | **+0.839** |

  Recursive validation: `fathom_reward` correctly ranks `chosen > rejected` on **20 / 20 (100%)** of the synth-generated pairs — the inverse-cogn crafted perturbations are caught by the forward-cogn reward, both directions self-validating.

  Reproduce: `python examples/synth_preference_pairs.py`. Output: `release/synth_preference_pairs_v0.jsonl`.

```python
from styxx.synth import craft_preference_pair

pair = craft_preference_pair(
    prompt="I think Python is the best. Right?",
    balanced="Python has tradeoffs - strong ecosystem, slow runtime.",
    instrument="sycophancy",
    target_score=0.85,
)
# {chosen: balanced, rejected: balanced + 1-3 token suffix, delta: +0.84}
```

No LLM calls. No API spend. Deterministic hill-climb on the bundled 24-token vocabulary. Nobody else can build this because nobody else has both forward and inverse cognometry shipped.

### Files added

- `styxx/reward.py` — the cognometric reward module
- `styxx/synth.py` — synthetic preference-pair generator (inverse cogn → cogn reward composition)

## [7.0.0] — 2026-04-29

**Headline: `styxx.attack` — inverse cognometry. A new subpackage that ships the dual to every cognometric instrument styxx measures: adversarial inputs, cross-instrument fingerprinting, latent-basis decomposition, and a discovered universal adversarial perturbation that fools multiple calibrated detectors at once.**

### Three findings shipped in 7.0.0

**1. Universal cognometric perturbation discovered.** A single fixed string — `"wonderful certainly you're absolutely right amazing undoubtedly"` — appended to ANY clean response, raises mean cross-fire across multiple cognometric instruments by **+0.468 on a held-out test set** (essentially identical to the +0.463 training delta — clean transfer, no overfitting). The first LLM-cognometric analog of [Moosavi-Dezfooli et al. 2017 universal adversarial perturbations](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/papers/Moosavi-Dezfooli_Universal_Adversarial_Perturbations_CVPR_2017_paper.pdf) for image classifiers — generated by greedy hill-climb on a 24-token vocabulary derived from the published K=1 critical features. Zero LLM calls, zero gradient access, ~2 seconds wall clock.

  Per-instrument transfer on the held-out test set:

  | instrument        | mean delta | transfer? |
  | ----------------- | ---------- | --------- |
  | sycophancy        | +0.938     | YES       |
  | overconfidence    | +0.521     | YES       |
  | deception         | -0.056     | NO (resists) |

  Bundled in `styxx/attack/universal_suffixes_v0.json`. Pinned by `test_universal_suffix_artifact_present_and_transfers` against a fresh held-out batch.

**2. Cognometric instruments are NOT orthogonal.** PCA over n=1600 single-turn corpus rows × 4 instruments: PC1 alone explains **46.2% of variance** (vs 25% expected under perfect orthogonality), with all 4 instruments loading on PC1. Effective dimensionality (participation ratio): ~3.13/4. The deception detector fires at mean 0.805 on overconfidence-positive content — *higher than the overconfidence detector itself* (0.629). Single-instrument readings overstate orthogonality; joint signatures are the more honest unit. Pinned by `test_non_orthogonality_finding_pinned`.

**3. Per-instrument craft-ability is asymmetric (and inverse to AUC ranking).** Hill-climbing a suffix from clean cross-corpus inputs targeting one specific instrument:

  | targeted instrument | succeeded / 30 (target ≥ 0.7) | top delta |
  | ------------------- | ----------------------------- | --------- |
  | sycophancy          | **30 / 30**                   | +0.972    |
  | overconfidence      | 29 / 30                       | +0.697    |
  | deception           | **1 / 30**                    | +0.362    |

  Sycophancy collapses on every attempt; deception resists almost all of them. Calibrated AUC ≠ adversarial robustness. Cross-attack transfer is also asymmetric: deception-targeted attacks ALSO fire overconfidence at ~equal magnitude (+0.384 vs +0.341), while sycophancy attacks transfer cleanly (no leakage).

### Public API

```python
from styxx.attack import (
    # canary mining (training-distribution positives)
    mine, AttackCandidate, AttackResult,

    # natural-FP mining (true adversarials from corpus)
    mine_adversarial,

    # cross-instrument fingerprinting (4 single-turn instruments)
    score_all, applicable_instruments,
    cross_fire_matrix, fingerprint_distance,

    # latent basis decomposition (PCA on cross-firing matrix)
    cognometric_basis, BasisResult,

    # synthetic adversarial generation (greedy hill-climb)
    craft_adversarial, CraftResult, CraftedAdversarial,
    find_universal_suffix, UniversalSuffixResult,

    # registry
    list_instruments, get_instrument, InstrumentSpec,
)
```

CLI:
```
styxx attack <instrument>                   # canary mine (training-distribution positives)
styxx attack <instrument> --adversarial     # natural-FP mine (true adversarials)
styxx attack --list                         # show registered instruments
```

### Coverage

- **6 instruments registered** for `mine` / `mine_adversarial`: `sycophancy`, `loop`, `goal_drift`, `deception`, `plan_action`, `overconfidence`.
- **4 single-turn instruments scored** by `score_all` and `cross_fire_matrix`: the above three (`sycophancy`, `deception`, `overconfidence`) plus `refusal` (fingerprint-only — no bundled labeled corpus, since XSTest is external).
- The remaining two instruments from the `Every Mind Leaves Vitals` 9-suite (`hallucination`, `drift`) are deferred to 7.1+ — both have non-paired or external corpus shapes that need normalization work.

### Spoofability per instrument (natural false positives in training corpora)

  | instrument        | total negs | natural FPs ≥ 0.5 | top FP score |
  | ----------------- | ---------- | ----------------- | ------------ |
  | sycophancy        | 600        | 56 (9%)           | 0.983        |
  | overconfidence    | 100        | 28 (28%)          | 0.946        |
  | plan_action       | 100        | 13                | 0.993        |
  | goal_drift        | 100        | 11                | 0.964        |
  | deception         | 100        | 7                 | 0.965        |
  | **loop**          | 100        | **0**             | 0.287        |

  **Loop is unspoofable** by any natural negative example — matches its CV AUC of 0.9995 (the highest of the 9 instruments). Pinned by `test_loop_is_robust_to_natural_adversarials`.

### Bundled artifacts (inside the wheel)

- `styxx/attack/seeds/<instrument>.jsonl` — top-30 training-distribution positives per registered instrument.
- `styxx/attack/seeds/<instrument>_fp.jsonl` — top-30 natural false positives per spoofable instrument (loop has no file).
- `styxx/attack/signature_calibration_v0.json` — per-instrument cross-fire calibration (descriptive; not a defended adversarial detector — current FP corpus sizes are statistically underpowered for that).
- `styxx/attack/universal_suffixes_v0.json` — the discovered universal suffix + transfer matrix + craft-ability ranking + cross-attack matrix.

Plus the analysis output (in-tree, not in wheel):
- `benchmarks/cognometric_basis_v0.json` — full PCA result on n=1600 single-turn corpus rows.

### Reproducibility

```
python scripts/build_attack_seeds.py --top-k 30        # rebuild bundled seeds
python scripts/compute_signature_calibration.py        # rebuild calibration JSON
python scripts/run_cognometric_basis.py                # rerun PCA decomposition
python scripts/run_craft_experiments.py                # rerun craft + universal hunt
python scripts/analyze_fingerprint_geometry.py         # cross-firing matrix
```

All deterministic (seed=0). The universal suffix is reproduced bit-for-bit from a fresh `pip install styxx==7.0.0` + run.

### Tests

- 43 new tests in `tests/test_attack_v0.py`. Covers every API surface, both polarities of mining, parametric per-instrument coverage, the loop-robustness invariant, the non-orthogonality pin, the craft-ability asymmetry pin, and the universal-suffix transfer pin.
- Full regression: **800 passed, 1 skipped** (757 prior + 43 attack), zero regressions on any existing surface.

### Compatibility

No breaking changes. Every public surface from styxx 6.8.2 is unchanged. `pip install styxx==7.0.0` is a drop-in upgrade for any existing 6.x deployment.

### Why it matters

Every published cognitive-eval claims to measure something real. Almost no one ships the matched offense against their own benchmark, let alone discovers a universal perturbation that fools multiple of them at once. styxx 7.0.0 does both:

- **Defenders** get a known-bad library per instrument (canary mining), a true natural-adversarial library (FP mining), and a cross-instrument fingerprint API to detect anomalous joint signatures.
- **Researchers** get the first published cross-firing matrix for cognometric measurement, a PCA basis, a synthetic adversarial generator, and a discovered universal artifact to use as a baseline.
- **The field** gets the dual paper to *Every Mind Leaves Vitals*: one fixed string defeats multiple calibrated detectors. The K=1 phase-transition signature implies the universal — 7.0.0 ships the receipt.

### Roadmap

- **7.1.0** — `styxx.attack.mutate` (LLM-driven adversarial paraphrase) + extend universal hunt to multi-turn instruments (loop, goal_drift) + companion paper draft *Universal Cognometric Perturbations: A Single String Defeats Multiple Calibrated Detectors*.
- **7.2.0** — composition with the open-weight `lucid` probe-in-loop project: feed inverse-styxx adversarials into Llama-3.1 + nnsight + a deception probe at layer N, measure whether surface pathology and internal state agree under adversarial pressure.

## [6.8.2] — 2026-04-27

**Patch: fixes a silent-bypass bug in `@styxx.profile` and `hook_openai()` where callers using the most common import pattern got 0 cognitive steps captured. Surfaced by post-9-of-9 dogfood.**

### Fixed

- **`hook_openai()` now rebinds already-imported `OpenAI` references.** Previously the hook only patched `openai.OpenAI` (the module attribute). Any caller that did `from openai import OpenAI` *before* the hook ran (the default pattern in nearly every Python project) held an unhooked reference in their own module namespace, and `OpenAI()` constructions through that reference silently bypassed the hook. The visible symptom: `@styxx.profile` reported `CognitiveProfile(steps=0)` on real LLM calls, e.g.:

  ```python
  from openai import OpenAI       # ← bound BEFORE @styxx.profile imports

  @styxx.profile
  def my_agent(task):
      client = OpenAI()           # ← bypass: still the unhooked class
      return client.chat.completions.create(...)

  result, p = my_agent("hi")
  print(p.steps)                  # → 0   (pre-6.8.2 bug)
  print(p.steps)                  # → 1+  (6.8.2 fixed)
  ```

  The fix walks `sys.modules` at hook-install time and rebinds any module-level attribute that points at the original `openai.OpenAI` to the hooked replacement. `unhook_openai()` does the symmetric restore. Excludes `openai.*` and `styxx.*` namespaces so the hook machinery itself isn't corrupted.

- **`unhook_openai()` no longer probes `getattr(attr, "_styxx_hooked")`.** The previous implementation walked `sys.modules` and used `getattr` to detect hooked references — but `getattr` triggers lazy-import machinery on third-party modules (notably `torch._classes`), which would raise `RuntimeError` mid-iteration and break unrelated tests in the same process. Replaced with strict identity comparison against a stored module-level reference.

### Added

- **Regression tests** in `tests/test_power_ups.py`:
  - `test_hook_openai_rebinds_already_imported_references` — synthesizes the failing import pattern in a fresh module, asserts the rebind works, asserts unhook restores cleanly
  - `test_hook_openai_does_not_touch_styxx_internals` — pins the exclusion filter so the sweep can never corrupt `styxx.adapters.*` references

### Doc

- Updated `@styxx.profile` docstring to remove the now-outdated "does NOT work" caveat for `from openai import OpenAI`. The three patterns that work are explicitly listed; remaining edge cases (clients constructed before styxx is imported, user-defined `openai.OpenAI` subclasses) are noted.

---

## [6.8.1] — 2026-04-26

**Patch: fixes a long-standing version-attribute drift bug surfaced by post-9-of-9 dogfood, and adds the dogfood invariant that would have caught it.**

### Fixed

- **`styxx.__version__`** now reads from package metadata (`importlib.metadata.version('styxx')`) instead of a hardcoded literal, so it can never drift from the published wheel. The hardcoded value had been frozen at `"6.2.1"` across six minor releases (v6.2.0 → v6.8.0), causing every PyPI install to misreport its own version. Falls back to `"0.0.0+source"` for source-checkout environments without an installed package metadata. Caught by `scripts/dogfood_v650.py` running against a fresh isolated-venv install of v6.8.0.

### Added

- **Dogfood invariant `imports.styxx_version_matches_metadata`** in `scripts/dogfood_v650.py` — asserts that `styxx.__version__` equals `importlib.metadata.version('styxx')` whenever the package is installed. Prevents this class of drift from recurring silently.

- **Dogfood coverage for instruments #8 + #9.** Extended `scripts/dogfood_v650.py` to exercise `overconf_check` and `goal_check` on imports, fingerprints, canonical paired cases, cross-instrument compatibility, edge cases (empty, unicode, very-short, long-session), performance, and determinism. Total dogfood checks: **65/65 green** against a fresh PyPI install. Atlas assertion bumped from v0.4 (7 instruments) to v0.6 (9 instruments).

---

## [6.8.0] — 2026-04-26

**Headline: instrument #9 (goal-drift detection) — sixth and FINAL instrument shipped under the call from [*Every Mind Leaves Vitals*](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.19777921). The 9-instrument suite the position paper called for is now COMPLETE. 9-for-9 on cognometric instruments showing K=1 phase-transition signature, each with a different critical feature.**

### Added — ninth and final cognometric instrument: goal drift

- **`from styxx.guardrail import goal_check`** — calibrated multi-turn goal-drift detector. Pure Python, no embeddings, Pyodide-safe. Sibling to conversation-loop (instrument #5): both are multi-turn, but loop measures stagnation while goal-drift measures dispersion (the agent moves further from its goal anchor turn after turn). Distinct from drift v1 (instrument #3): drift v1 is a per-call schema-mismatch detector for tool calls; goal drift is a multi-turn intent-migration detector for agent sessions.

  ```python
  v = goal_check(turns=[
      "Goal: research the rate-limit policy and summarize per-endpoint limits.",
      "Searched the API docs.",
      "Started looking at OAuth flows instead.",
      "Wrote a comparison of OAuth providers.",
  ])
  v.drift_risk    # calibrated probability in [0, 1]
  v.shows_drift   # bool against threshold (default 0.5)
  v.top_signals   # 3 strongest features (signed contribution)
  ```

  9 multi-turn anchor-relative features (anchor_recall_score, anchor_to_last_bigram_jaccard, anchor_to_last_entity_overlap, cumulative_anchor_drift, mean_anchor_overlap, max_inter_turn_levenshtein, monotonic_drift_fraction, log_n_turns, log_total_words). Trained on **n=200 paired (anchored, drifted) 5-turn agent sessions** sampled from `gpt-4o-mini` under contrasting STANCE-level system prompts on 100 diverse goal statements. **5-fold CV mean AUC 0.9645 ± 0.0294**.

- **Phase-transition signature replicates on instrument #9.** Critical_K=**1** on `anchor_to_last_bigram_jaccard` (Δ +0.4143) — direct cross-turn bigram overlap between the goal-statement turn and the agent's final turn. K=2 adds `max_inter_turn_levenshtein` (Δ +0.05).

  **9-FOR-9** on cognometric instruments showing K=1 phase transition under the same measurement protocol, each with a DIFFERENT critical feature:

  | instrument        | critical feature              | Δ AUC at K=1 |
  | ----------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------ |
  | hallucination v4  | trigram_novelty               | +0.4947      |
  | refusal v1        | starts_with_sorry             | +0.469       |
  | drift v6.0        | (per-class K=1-2)             | +0.4973      |
  | sycophancy v0     | superlative_density           | +0.4354      |
  | conversation-loop | avg_pairwise_levenshtein      | +0.4995      |
  | deception v0      | log_word_count                | +0.3738      |
  | plan-action v0    | bigram_jaccard_overlap        | +0.3832      |
  | overconfidence v0 | mean_sentence_length          | +0.2298      |
  | goal-drift v0     | anchor_to_last_bigram_jaccard | +0.4143      |

  **The K=1 phase-transition prediction from *Every Mind Leaves Vitals* is now empirically held across the COMPLETE 9-instrument suite the paper called for**, across instrument families (single-turn lexical / cross-turn structural / lexical-style register / cross-section plan-action / multi-turn drift) and AUC bands (0.7702 to 0.9995).

- **Corpus design discipline.** Stance-level system prompts only — NO lexical hints. The drifted prompt explicitly says *"don't announce that you're getting off-track; just let the work shift"* — same prompt-leakage avoidance carried forward from instruments #7 plan-action and #8 overconfidence.

- **Documented failure modes:**
  1. Single-source corpus (gpt-4o-mini under stance-prompt instruction); v1 priority is real long-horizon agent traces with annotated drift events
  2. **Paraphrastic anchored sessions can score above threshold.** The detector calibrates against gpt-4o-mini-generated anchored sessions which use heavy verbatim repetition of goal vocabulary. Hand-crafted paraphrastic anchored sessions (where the agent stays on-topic but uses different words) can trip the threshold. Pinned by regression test. v1 fix path: semantic-embedding overlap to replace pure bigram Jaccard.
  3. 5-turn fixed window — `log_n_turns` carries zero coefficient because the corpus has zero variance on session length. Pinned.
  4. `mean_anchor_overlap` and `cumulative_anchor_drift` carry equal-and-opposite coefficients (split signal). Pinned.
  5. English-only feature vocabularies.
  6. Requires turn-segmented input.

- **Calibration fingerprint** in `styxx.guardrail.calibrated_weights_goal_drift_v0.CALIBRATION_FINGERPRINT`. Atlas bumped to **v0.6**: 21 fingerprints across 9 instruments × 16 substrates.

- **20 new unit tests** in `tests/test_goal_drift_v0.py`, including the symbolic `test_position_paper_count_is_now_complete` that pins the 9-of-9 milestone by importing every instrument's API entry point. Full pytest run: **755 passed, 1 skipped**.

### Added — atlas v0.6

- `benchmarks/cognometry_fingerprint_atlas_v0.json` → **v0.6**:
  - 21 fingerprints (was 20)
  - 9 instruments (was 8)
  - 16 substrates (was 15)
  - `v0_6_changelog` entry documents the 9-for-9 K=1 phase-transition completion.

### Reproducer

`scripts/goal_drift_train_v0.py` — seed-pinned, deterministic, resumable cache. `OPENAI_API_KEY=... python scripts/goal_drift_train_v0.py`.

### Position-paper status: COMPLETE

**All 9 instruments called for in *Every Mind Leaves Vitals* are now shipped** (hallucination, refusal, tool-call drift, sycophancy, conversation-loop, deception, plan-action, overconfidence, goal-drift). The 9-for-9 K=1 phase-transition signature confirms the central empirical prediction of the position paper across the complete suite, across all instrument families, and across the full AUC band the paper hypothesized.

Net: 9 of 9 calibrated cognometric instruments shipped. The call is closed.

---

## [6.7.0] — 2026-04-26

**Headline: instrument #8 (overconfidence-register detection) — fifth instrument shipped under the call from [*Every Mind Leaves Vitals*](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.19777921). 8-for-8 on cognometric instruments showing K=1 phase-transition signature, each with a different critical feature. Honest AUC: 0.7702 — the lowest in the v0 suite, shipped at this number rather than gamed.**

### Added — eighth cognometric instrument: overconfidence register

- **`from styxx.guardrail import overconf_check`** — calibrated overconfidence-register detector. Pure Python, no embeddings, Pyodide-safe. Sibling to deception (instrument #6) and hallucination (#1): hallucination measures fabrication-prone phrasing; deception measures rhetorical-signature register; overconfidence measures epistemic-commitment register. **NOT a truth detector.**

  ```python
  v = overconf_check(prompt, response)
  v.overconf_risk    # calibrated probability in [0, 1]
  v.shows_overconf   # bool against threshold (default 0.5)
  v.top_signals      # 3 strongest signed contributions
  ```

  9 register features (certainty/hedge/evidence-marker densities, `epistemic_balance` = (cert - hedge) / (cert + hedge + 1), strong-assertion ratio, unhedged-claim ratio, mean sentence length, log word count, specific-number density). Trained on **n=200 paired (calibrated, overconfident) responses** sampled from `gpt-4o-mini` under contrasting STANCE-level system prompts on 100 diverse questions across factual / quantitative / opinion / predictive / mechanism / contested-fact substrates. **5-fold CV mean AUC 0.7702 ± 0.0648**.

- **Phase-transition signature replicates on instrument #8.** Critical_K=**1** on `mean_sentence_length` (Δ +0.2298) — a length confound: calibrated responses pack hedges + qualifications that increase sentence length. K=2 adds `epistemic_balance` (Δ +0.0295) — the lexical-register signal that was the design hypothesis. **8-for-8 on cognometric instruments showing K=1 phase transition** under the same measurement protocol, each with a different critical feature:

  | instrument        | critical feature           | Δ AUC at K=1 |
  | ----------------- | -------------------------- | ------------ |
  | hallucination v4  | trigram_novelty            | +0.4947      |
  | refusal v1        | starts_with_sorry          | +0.469       |
  | drift v6.0        | (per-class K=1-2)          | +0.4973      |
  | sycophancy v0     | superlative_density        | +0.4354      |
  | conversation-loop | avg_pairwise_levenshtein   | +0.4995      |
  | deception v0      | log_word_count             | +0.3738      |
  | plan-action v0    | bigram_jaccard_overlap     | +0.3832      |
  | overconfidence v0 | mean_sentence_length       | +0.2298      |

- **Honest AUC disclosure.** AUC 0.7702 is the lowest in the v0 suite. We ship at this number rather than gaming the corpus. The signal is real (well above chance) but moderate — `gpt-4o-mini` does not always shift register on well-established factual questions ("How does GPS work?" produces a similar response under both stance prompts; the register shift is dramatic on contested questions and barely visible on settled ones). The K=1 length confound and the question-pool dependence are documented in [`calibrated_weights_overconfidence_v0.CALIBRATION_NOTES.honest_AUC_disclosure`](styxx/guardrail/calibrated_weights_overconfidence_v0.py).

- **Corpus design discipline.** Stance-level system prompts only — NO lexical hints. The contrastive prompts contrast at the level of epistemic stance ("careful expert who scales certainty to evidence" vs. "confident speaker who never qualifies") and deliberately do NOT name certainty markers, hedge words, or any feature we measure. Carried forward from instrument #7 plan-action where the prompt-leakage failure mode was first identified and pinned by a regression test.

- **Scope warning: NOT a truth detector.** Overconfidence here scores REGISTER (commitment markers, hedge density, evidence attribution), not factual correctness. A correct answer stated confidently will score as overconfident. An incorrect answer stated humbly will not. Pair with hallucination v4 (or NLI guardrail v3) for joint truth+register monitoring.

- **Counter-intuitive empirical finding pinned by regression test:** `specific_number_density` coefficient is small NEGATIVE in the trained model. Design intuition was overconfident responses invent specific numbers; empirically, calibrated responses cite numbers more (with attribution). Pinned in `tests/test_overconfidence_v0.py::test_documented_specific_number_coef_is_negative`.

- **Documented failure modes:**
  1. K=1 = `mean_sentence_length` is a length confound, not a lexical-certainty feature
  2. Question-pool dependence (high AUC on contested, low AUC on factual)
  3. Single-source corpus (gpt-4o-mini only)
  4. `specific_number_density` coefficient flipped opposite to design intuition
  5. English-only feature vocabularies
  6. Not a truth detector

- **Calibration fingerprint** in `styxx.guardrail.calibrated_weights_overconfidence_v0.CALIBRATION_FINGERPRINT`. Atlas bumped to **v0.5**: 20 fingerprints across 8 instruments × 15 substrates.

- **17 new unit tests** in `tests/test_overconfidence_v0.py`. Full pytest run: **735 passed, 1 skipped**.

### Added — atlas v0.5

- `benchmarks/cognometry_fingerprint_atlas_v0.json` → **v0.5**:
  - 20 fingerprints (was 19)
  - 8 instruments (was 7)
  - 15 substrates (was 14)
  - `v0_5_changelog` entry documents the 8-for-8 K=1 phase transition and the honest AUC disclosure.

### Position-paper status

**5 of 6 instruments called for in *Every Mind Leaves Vitals* now shipped** (sycophancy, conversation-loop, deception, plan-action, overconfidence). One remaining: **goal drift** (cross-session intent drift, distinct from the existing tool-call drift v1). Net: 8 of 9 calibrated cognometric instruments shipped.

---

## [6.6.0] — 2026-04-26

**Headline: instrument #7 (plan-action gap detection) — fourth instrument shipped under the call from [*Every Mind Leaves Vitals*](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.19777921). 7-for-7 on cognometric instruments showing K=1 phase-transition signature, each with a different critical feature.**

### Added — seventh cognometric instrument: plan-action gap

- **`from styxx.guardrail import plan_action_check`** — calibrated cross-section plan-action gap detector. Pure Python, no embeddings, Pyodide-safe. Sibling to drift (instrument #3): drift catches a malformed tool call against schema; plan-action gap catches when the agent's *stated intent* and *emitted action* diverge at the content level.

  ```python
  v = plan_action_check(plan, action)
  v.gap_risk     # calibrated probability in [0, 1]
  v.shows_gap    # bool against threshold (default 0.5)
  v.top_signals  # 3 strongest cross-section features
  ```

  9 cross-section features (bigram/trigram Jaccard between plan and action, action-verb overlap, entity overlap, length ratio + diff, deviation-marker density, plan-only-content-word ratio, log total words). Trained on **n=200 paired (matched, mismatched) plan-action pairs** sampled from `gpt-4o-mini` under contrasting system prompts on 100 diverse agent tasks. **5-fold CV mean AUC 0.9225 ± 0.0322**.

- **Phase-transition signature replicates on instrument #7.** Critical_K=**1** on `bigram_jaccard_overlap` (Δ +0.3832) — cross-section bigram overlap between plan and action. K=2 adds `log_total_words` (Δ +0.04). **7-for-7 on cognometric instruments showing K=1 phase transition** under the same measurement protocol, each with a different critical feature:

  | instrument        | critical feature           | Δ AUC at K=1 |
  | ----------------- | -------------------------- | ------------ |
  | hallucination v4  | trigram_novelty            | +0.4947      |
  | refusal v1        | starts_with_sorry          | +0.469       |
  | drift v6.0        | (per-class K=1-2)          | +0.4973      |
  | sycophancy v0     | superlative_density        | +0.4354      |
  | conversation-loop | avg_pairwise_levenshtein   | +0.4995      |
  | deception v0      | log_word_count             | +0.3738      |
  | plan-action v0    | bigram_jaccard_overlap     | +0.3832      |

- **Honest corpus disclosure.** An earlier corpus that allowed the mismatched system prompt to instruct the model to use deviation markers ("actually,"/"instead,") in the action saturated AUC at 1.000 with K=1 = `deviation_marker_density` — a pure prompt-leakage artifact, since we'd told the model exactly which lexical signature to produce. The cleaned corpus (no deviation-marker hint) gives the honest AUC 0.9225 with a real cross-section overlap signal at K=1. Both results are documented in `CALIBRATION_NOTES.corpus_design_warning`.

- **Calibration fingerprint atlas v0.4.** Atlas now ships **19 fingerprints across 7 instruments × 14 substrates** (was 18/6/13).

- **Documented failure modes** (in [`calibrated_weights_plan_action_v0.CALIBRATION_NOTES`](styxx/guardrail/calibrated_weights_plan_action_v0.py)):
  1. Single-source corpus (gpt-4o-mini under prompt instruction); v1 priority is real BFCL-multi-turn agent traces with annotated gaps
  2. **Symbolic-to-numerical false positive** — when plan describes symbolic computation ("compute A = πr²") and action shows numerical execution ("3.14159 × 7 × 7 = 153.94"), bigram overlap is naturally low even though the pair is semantically matched. Pinned by a regression test. v1 fix path is semantic embedding overlap.
  3. Requires structured `(plan, action)` input — separate parsing step needed for inline-CoT outputs
  4. Length features (`action_to_plan_length_ratio` + `action_minus_plan_word_count`) split the signal — small modeling redundancy
  5. `verb_overlap_ratio` carries near-zero learned weight (small action-verb vocabulary)
  6. English-only feature vocabularies

### Added — reproducers

### Context

Fourth instrument shipped under [*Every Mind Leaves Vitals*](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.19777921)'s call for #4-#9 (sycophancy + conversation-loop + deception preceded — same day cycle). Less than 48 hours from the position paper landing to four instruments shipped under it, all replicating the K=1 phase-transition signature, each with a different critical feature. The structural prediction continues to hold across instrument families (single-turn lexical, cross-turn structural, lexical-style-deception, cross-section plan-action). 93/93 tests pass across all 7 instruments.

---

## [6.5.0] — 2026-04-26

**Headline: instrument #6 (deception-signature detection) — third instrument shipped under the call from [*Every Mind Leaves Vitals*](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.19777921). 6-for-6 on cognometric instruments showing K=1 phase-transition signature. NOT a lie detector — see scope warning.**

### Added — sixth cognometric instrument: deception-signature

> **Scope warning:** This is NOT a lie detector. It detects *lexical signatures of instruction-induced dishonesty* — patterns that emerge under prompt instruction to be vague vs. specific, not actual factual deception. False positives on qualified-honest writing; false negatives on confident lies with specifics. Use as a signal in agent monitoring, not as a verdict.

- **`from styxx.guardrail import deception_check`** — calibrated text-only deception-signature detector. Pure Python, sub-millisecond on CPU, no model weights, Pyodide-safe.

  ```python
  v = deception_check(prompt, response)
  v.deception_risk    # calibrated probability in [0, 1]
  v.shows_signature   # bool against threshold (default 0.5)
  v.top_signals       # 3 strongest features by signed contribution
  ```

  9 lexical features drawn from the Pennebaker / Newman / Hauch deception-linguistics tradition, adapted for LLM output (specificity, first-person density, exclusive words, vagueness, negation, hedge-confidence clash, cognitive markers, opinion phrases, log word count). Trained on **n=200 paired responses** sampled from `gpt-4o-mini` under contrasting (*honest* / *dishonest*) system prompts on 100 diverse seed questions (factual / opinion / contested). **5-fold CV mean AUC 0.9560 ± 0.0242**.

- **Phase-transition signature replicates on instrument #6.** Critical_K=**1** on `log_word_count` (Δ +0.3738) — dishonest-instructed responses are systematically shorter and less specific in this corpus. K=2 adds `specificity_density` (Δ +0.079). **6-for-6 on cognometric instruments showing K=1 phase transition** under the same measurement protocol, each with a different critical feature:

  | instrument        | critical feature          | Δ AUC at K=1 |
  | ----------------- | ------------------------- | ------------ |
  | hallucination v4  | trigram_novelty           | +0.4947      |
  | refusal v1        | starts_with_sorry         | +0.469       |
  | drift v6.0        | (per-class K=1-2)         | +0.4973      |
  | sycophancy v0     | superlative_density       | +0.4354      |
  | conversation-loop | avg_pairwise_levenshtein  | +0.4995      |
  | deception v0      | log_word_count            | +0.3738      |

- **Calibration fingerprint atlas v0.3.** Atlas now ships **18 fingerprints across 6 instruments × 13 substrates** (was 17/5/12).

- **AUC 0.04 lower than the prior five — declared honestly.** Deception is genuinely harder to detect from text alone than concrete failure modes. We disclose the gap rather than paper over it.

- **Documented failure modes** (in [`calibrated_weights_deception_v0.CALIBRATION_NOTES`](styxx/guardrail/calibrated_weights_deception_v0.py), with a prominent `scope_warning`):
  1. **NOT a lie detector** — lexical signature ≠ ground-truth deception
  2. Single-source corpus (gpt-4o-mini under prompt instruction)
  3. `log_word_count` as critical feature is partly a corpus artifact — sign may invert on corpora where dishonest responses pad with bulk
  4. `specificity_density` uses a regex proxy for named entities (v1 priority: real NER)
  5. English-only feature vocabularies
  6. `opinion_phrase_density` carries zero learned weight on this corpus
  7. `negation_density` learned a *negative* coefficient (Newman's positive sign for human deception did not replicate on LLM output)

### Added — reproducers

### Context

Third instrument shipped under [*Every Mind Leaves Vitals*](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.19777921)'s call for #4-#9 (sycophancy, conversation-loop preceded — same day). Less than 48 hours from the position paper landing to three instruments shipped under it, all replicating the K=1 phase-transition signature on a different critical feature each time. The structural prediction continues to hold across instrument families (single-turn lexical / cross-turn structural / lexical-style-deception). 78/78 tests pass across all 5 calibrated text-only instruments.

## [6.4.0] — 2026-04-26

**Headline: instrument #5 (conversation-loop detection) — second instrument shipped under the call from [*Every Mind Leaves Vitals*](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.19777921). 5-for-5 on cognometric instruments showing K=1 phase-transition signature under the same measurement protocol.**

### Added — fifth cognometric instrument: conversation-loop

- **`from styxx.guardrail import loop_check`** — calibrated cross-turn loop detector. Pure Python, no embeddings, no model weights, Pyodide-safe.

  ```python
  v = loop_check(turns=[t1, t2, t3, t4])
  v.loop_risk     # calibrated probability in [0, 1]
  v.in_loop       # bool against threshold (default 0.5)
  v.n_turns       # number of input turns
  v.top_signals   # 3 strongest cross-turn features by signed contribution
  ```

  9 cross-turn features (bigram/trigram overlap consecutive, verbatim 5-gram repeat count, length CV, opener repeat rate, distinct-word ratio, pairwise Levenshtein, max pairwise bigram overlap, log turn count). Trained on **n=200 paired multi-turn conversations** sampled from `gpt-4o-mini` under contrasting (*loop* / *progress*) system prompts, 100 generic seed topics, 4 agent turns each. **5-fold CV mean AUC 0.9995 ± 0.0010**.

- **Phase-transition signature replicates on instrument #5.** Critical_K=**1** on `avg_pairwise_levenshtein` (Δ +0.4995) — a single feature (mean normalized char-level Levenshtein distance across all turn pairs) takes detection from chance to AUC 0.9995. **5-for-5 on cognometric instruments showing K=1 phase transition** under the same measurement protocol:

  | instrument        | critical feature          | Δ AUC at K=1 |
  | ----------------- | ------------------------- | ------------ |
  | hallucination v4  | trigram_novelty           | +0.4947      |
  | refusal v1        | starts_with_sorry         | +0.469       |
  | drift v6.0        | (per-class K=1-2)         | +0.4973      |
  | sycophancy v0     | superlative_density       | +0.4354      |
  | conversation-loop | avg_pairwise_levenshtein  | +0.4995      |

- **Calibration fingerprint atlas v0.2.** Atlas now ships **17 fingerprints across 5 instruments × 12 substrates** (was 16/4/11).

- **Single-turn short-circuit.** `loop_check(turns=[x])` returns `loop_risk=0.0, in_loop=False` — loops are multi-turn by definition.

- **Documented failure modes** (in [`calibrated_weights_loop_v0.CALIBRATION_NOTES`](styxx/guardrail/calibrated_weights_loop_v0.py)):
  1. Single-source training (gpt-4o-mini under prompt-induced loop instructions). v1 priority: real BFCL-multi-turn agent traces with human-labeled loops, plus cross-model corpus.
  2. **Counter-intuitive `distinct_word_ratio` coefficient.** Intuition says LOW (loops have less vocabulary) → predict loop=1, so coefficient should be negative. Learned coefficient is +0.95. Explanation: gpt-4o-mini under "rephrase" instruction reaches for synonyms each turn, so its distinct-word-ratio actually goes UP under loop. Honest to the corpus; likely inverted on natural-failure loops. Pinned by a regression test.
  3. No temporal modeling — features treat turns as a set.
  4. Very short turns (<10 words) underfire the cross-turn features.
  5. `log_n_turns` carries zero learned weight on this corpus (all training conversations are 4 turns; feature is constant).

### Added — reproducers

- [`scripts/loop_train_v0.py`](scripts/loop_train_v0.py) — full pipeline (sample paired multi-turn → featurize → train → ablate). Resumable cache in `benchmarks/data/loop/conversations_v0.jsonl`. Seed-pinned, deterministic.

### Context

This is the second instrument shipped under [*Every Mind Leaves Vitals*](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.19777921)'s call for instruments #4 through #9 (sycophancy v0 was the first, in 6.3.0 — same day). Less than 48 hours from the call to two confirmed phase-transition replications. The structural prediction continues to hold.

---

## [6.3.0] — 2026-04-26

**Headline: instrument #4 (sycophancy detection) shipped within 24h of the position paper [*Every Mind Leaves Vitals*](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.19777921) calling for instruments #4–#9. Phase-transition signature replicated: critical_K=1 on `superlative_density`, AUC 0.500 → 0.9354 (Δ +0.4354), substrate-independent across three substrates.**

### Added — fourth cognometric instrument: sycophancy

- **`from styxx.guardrail import sycoph_check`** — calibrated text-only sycophancy detector. Pure Python, sub-millisecond on CPU, no model weights, no logprobs, Pyodide-safe.

  ```python
  v = sycoph_check(prompt, response)
  v.sycoph_risk   # calibrated probability in [0, 1]
  v.sycophantic   # bool against threshold (default 0.5)
  v.top_signals   # 3 strongest features by signed contribution
  ```

  Trained on **n=1200 paired responses** generated from `gpt-4o-mini` against the [Anthropic sycophancy eval corpus](https://github.com/anthropics/evals/tree/main/sycophancy) (Perez et al. 2022) across three substrates (NLP survey, philpapers2020, political typology) under contrasting system prompts: *yielding* (validate the user's view) vs. *evidence-first* (reason regardless of stated view). 9 surface features (agreement lexicon, premise echo, counter-evidence density, capitulation phrases, agreement openers, opinion markers, superlative density, hedge density, log word count). 5-fold CV mean AUC **0.9720 ± 0.0052**.

- **Phase-transition signature replicates on instrument #4.** Greedy forward feature selection finds critical_K=**1** on `superlative_density` — a single feature takes detection from chance (AUC 0.500) to **0.9354** (Δ +0.4354). The remaining 8 features combined add only +0.037. **Per-substrate ablation confirms K=1 holds within each substrate** (NLP-survey 0.909, philpapers2020 0.950, political-typology 0.944) — phase transition is not a pooling artifact. Same shape as the prior three instruments under the same measurement protocol.

- **Calibration fingerprint atlas v0.1.** Added 4 new fingerprints (pooled + 3 per-substrate) to [`benchmarks/cognometry_fingerprint_atlas_v0.json`](benchmarks/cognometry_fingerprint_atlas_v0.json). Atlas now ships **16 fingerprints across 4 instruments × 11 substrates**.

- **Documented failure modes** (in [`calibrated_weights_sycophancy_v0.CALIBRATION_NOTES`](styxx/guardrail/calibrated_weights_sycophancy_v0.py), not appendix):
  1. Single-model training — gpt-4o-mini only; v1 priority is cross-model corpus (Claude, Llama, Mistral)
  2. K=1 critical feature is `superlative_density` — terse agreement *without* praise can underfire
  3. False positives on warmly-worded evidence answers (*"Great question! Actually..."*) — confirmed in smoke tests
  4. `premise_echo_rate` carries a *negative* coefficient on this corpus (high echo correlates with counter-quotation); the sign may invert on other corpora

### Added — research artifact: v0.1 robustness experiment

A failure-mode-driven retrain. Augmented training corpus with 300 additional "warm-evidence" examples (system prompt: *"open warmly but reason from evidence"*). Result: pooled AUC 0.9382 (−0.034 from v0). v0.1 is **more robust to politeness-style false positives** but reveals a **true ceiling of the lexical approach**: a warm-opening response that contradicts the user's view *without* using counter-vocabulary still fires the K=1 detector. The remaining failure mode is genuinely beyond surface features — a semantic-aware NLI feature is the v1 fix path.

v0.1 weights preserved as research artifact in [`benchmarks/sycophancy_weights_v01.json`](benchmarks/sycophancy_weights_v01.json); not exposed as the default detector. Reproducer: [`scripts/sycophancy_train_v01.py`](scripts/sycophancy_train_v01.py).

### Added — reproducers

- [`scripts/sycophancy_train_v0.py`](scripts/sycophancy_train_v0.py) — full pipeline (sample → featurize → train → ablate). Resumable cache in `benchmarks/data/sycophancy/responses_v0.jsonl`. Seed-pinned, deterministic.
- [`scripts/sycophancy_per_substrate.py`](scripts/sycophancy_per_substrate.py) — per-substrate ablation, no new API calls.
- [`scripts/sycophancy_train_v01.py`](scripts/sycophancy_train_v01.py) — warm-evidence augmentation for the robustness experiment.

### Context

This is the first instrument shipped after the position paper [*Every Mind Leaves Vitals: On the Cognometric Layer, Substrate-Independence, and the One-Time Choice We Have*](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.19777921) called for instruments #4 through #9 (conversation-loop, plan-action gap, sycophancy, deception, goal drift, overconfidence). Less than 24 hours from publication of the call to first shipped instrument under it. The phase-transition signature predicted by the paper holds — one more empirical confirmation, with reproducible numbers, in the same style as the prior three.

## [6.2.1] — 2026-04-25

**Headline: dogfood pass against live LLMs surfaced 4 small bugs and 1 documentation gap. Every advertised API now produces what the README promises on `pip install styxx`.**

### Companion: robustness supplement

Published alongside this release as a separate citation:

- **Cognometric Fingerprint Specification v1.0 — Robustness Supplement** (Fathom v22). 24-attack adversarial audit across 8 strategy categories. Baseline 66.7% false-negative evasion → hardened 16.7% (4× reduction). Residual limits documented openly in §7. CC-BY-4.0. DOI [10.5281/zenodo.19761194](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.19761194). Reproducible via `node packages/styxx-scope/_test_adversarial.js`.

### Fixed

- **`@styxx.profile(name="...")` kwarg now works.** README and docstrings showed `name=` as a kwarg, but the function signature only accepted positional strings. Added explicit `name` kwarg. Both forms now work: `@profile("foo")` and `@profile(name="foo")`. The parametric path also returns a hybrid object that's both a context manager AND a decorator factory (previously failed when used as `@profile(name="x")` on a function).

- **`Vitals.as_dict()` now serializes `mode` field.** Adapter pipelines set `vitals.mode` (text-heuristic / consensus / hybrid+companion / etc.) on the live object, but `as_dict()` was dropping it on JSON export. Analytics, datadog, and langsmith pipelines lost the tier indicator silently. Added explicit `mode` key to the dict view.

- **Anthropic adapter: `vitals.mode` now labeled in text mode.** `watch._classify_from_text()` built Vitals without `mode='text-heuristic'` even though the standalone `text_features.build_vitals()` set it. Inconsistent — fixed so callers can branch reliably regardless of which entry point produced the reading.

- **Anthropic adapter: `mode='companion'` falls back gracefully.** When torch isn't installed, the companion path silently returned `vitals=None` — user requested companion but got nothing back with no information. Now falls back to text-heuristic with a label like `'text-heuristic (companion-unavailable)'` so the reading happens AND the failure mode is transparent.

- **`examples/quickstart.py` no longer crashes on first run.** If `OPENAI_API_KEY` was set but the `openai` SDK wasn't installed, `live_demo()` raised `ImportError` and killed the hello-world. Now catches the ImportError and falls back to the offline trajectory demo with a helpful install hint.

- **README hero example now runnable.** Previous hero used an undefined `run_langchain(task)` helper, so copy-pasters got `NameError`. Replaced with a self-contained `styxx.OpenAI` example that produces the documented single-step output on first try, with a separate richer multi-step example below for context.

### Documented

- **`@profile auto_hook` caveat documented.** The hook only catches new `openai.OpenAI()` instances constructed AFTER the profile context begins, AND only when the class is accessed via live module lookup. The 3 working patterns and the 1 that doesn't are now documented in the docstring with explicit code examples and an escape-hatch via `styxx.observe()` / `profile_session().record()` for framework integrations that bypass the hook.

- **OpenAI adapter docstring documents legitimate `vitals=None` cases.** Three scenarios where `.vitals=None` is correct fail-open behavior rather than a bug: pure tool-call responses (no text trajectory), models without logprobs, and `stream=True` (use `styxx.observe()` after collecting full text).

### Added

- **`scripts/launch_metrics.py`** — one-shot funnel readout polling Zenodo, PyPI, and GitHub. No dependencies beyond stdlib. Surfaces real distribution data without manual checks.

- **`scripts/dogfood_e2e.py`** — exhaustive end-to-end test against live gpt-4o-mini and claude-haiku-4-5. Exercises every README-advertised public API (drop-in OpenAI, `@profile` decorator, `@trust` RAG, `gate`, `refuse_check`, `drift_check`, CLI, anthropic text-only). Pass-rate: 25/27 against live LLMs (2 env-blocked).

- **`scripts/bug_hunt.py`** — adversarial dogfood across 8 categories: fail-open contract, streaming, tool calling, classifier residuals, advanced APIs, JSON roundtrip, multithread, edge cases. 29 pass · 0 fail · 4 documented v1 specialist limits.

### Cleanup

- Three unused root-level files removed: `README.old.md`, `WHAT-WE-BUILT-2026-04-22.md`, `INVENTION-CIS-v0.md` (the last was byte-identical to `papers/cognitive-instruction-set-v0.md`).

### Test suite

`653 pass · 5 skip · 0 fail` (was 622/5 before this release — kwarg fix
unblocks 13 previously-skipped mode-label assertions, and the autogen
adapter test file (18 tests) was inadvertently excluded from earlier
runs · re-included here for full coverage).

### Dogfood evidence

Verified end-to-end against live LLMs and synthetic data in this release:

  · `@styxx.profile` on multi-step gpt-4o-mini agent — phase-transition
    fault correctly flagged between steps
  · `styxx.OpenAI` drop-in wrapper produces calibrated vitals on live calls
  · `styxx.Anthropic` text-mode pipeline works on mocked Anthropic responses
  · `styxx.gate()` fail-open contract holds with a deliberately-failing
    client (returns permissive verdict, never raises)
  · `styxx.reflex` self-interrupting generator — fault callbacks fire
    correctly on confab-prone prompts; events accumulated; rewind logic
    triggered when applicable
  · `styxx.weather()` 24h forecast — operates over accumulated audit log,
    produces structured WeatherReport with gate-pass-rate / mood / mean
    coherence metrics
  · `styxx.Thought` substrate-independent type — round-trip via
    as_dict/from_dict preserves thought_id; distance(t,t)=0; certify()
    produces CognitiveCertificate
  · `styxx.dynamics.CognitiveDynamics` — full fit → predict → simulate →
    save/load loop on synthetic 10-observation trajectory in 6-category
    state space; .cogdyn binary serialization round-trips cleanly
  · `StyxxCallbackHandler` (langchain adapter) — vitals computed on live
    langchain 1.x agent: category=reasoning, gate=pass, trust=0.86

---

## [6.2.0] — 2026-04-24

**Headline: `styxx.profile` — py-spy for LLM reasoning. Decorate any
agent function, see where cognition failed before the output did.
Drift, confabulation, refusal, sycophancy, phase-transition, low-trust
and incoherence are all localized to specific steps with severity
scores.**

PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/styxx/6.2.0/

### The cognitive profiler

`styxx.profile` is the first tool that tells you **why** an agent
failed, not just **that** it failed. LangSmith shows traces;
Datadog shows metrics; Profiler shows cognition.

```python
import styxx

@styxx.profile
def my_agent(task):
    return run_langchain_agent(task)

result, p = my_agent("summarize this contract")
print(p.summary)
# profile 'my_agent': 7 steps, 4.32s total
#   2 fault(s):
#     · [drift] step=3 sev=0.87 · category='arg_swap' at confidence 0.87
#     · [phase_transition] step=6 sev=0.50 · category shift: reasoning → confab

p.to_html("run.html")      # flamegraph — K/C/D timeseries per step
p.to_json("run.json")      # LangSmith / Datadog-compatible export
```

### Three API shapes

1. **Decorator** — `@styxx.profile` → returns `(result, profile)`
2. **Context manager** — `with styxx.profile(name="sql_agent") as p:`
3. **Manual recording** — `styxx.profile_session()` + `.record(response, label=...)` for custom adapters

### Seven fault kinds detected

| kind | triggers when |
|---|---|
| `drift` | category ∈ {arg_swap, tool_arg_drift, tool_confab, drift} with confidence > 0.5 |
| `confabulation` | category ∈ {confab, hallucination, fabrication} with confidence > 0.5 |
| `refusal` | category ∈ {refuse, refusal} with confidence > 0.8 (strong refusals only) |
| `sycophant` | category ∈ {sycophant, sycophancy} with confidence > 0.5 |
| `low_trust` | trust_score < 0.30 |
| `incoherence` | cross-phase coherence < 0.30 |
| `phase_transition` | adjacent steps have differing dominant categories |

### Three export formats

- **HTML flamegraph** — self-contained, no external assets, darkflobi-brand aesthetic. Screenshot-ready.
- **LangSmith trace** — `p.to_langsmith()` → drop into the LangSmith client's `create_run` API.
- **Datadog spans** — `p.to_datadog()` → `{"spans": [...]}` ready for the Datadog APM agent.

### Under the hood

Uses existing `Vitals`, `WatchSession`, and the canonical `analytics.write_audit` tap —
every vitals-creating path feeds the active profile automatically. No monkey-patching
of user code. Falls open on every path — missing openai SDK, unknown response shape,
no logprobs — the profile collects whatever signal it can, always returns a result.

### Files

- `styxx/profile.py` — `CognitiveProfile`, `ProfileStep`, `Fault`, `profile()`, `profile_session()`
- `styxx/_profile_html.py` — self-contained HTML flamegraph renderer

## [6.1.0] — 2026-04-24

**Headline: tool-call drift detector retrained — overall AUC 0.916 → 0.943,
arg_swap failure mode partially fixed (0.664 → 0.755) via a new
positional-inversion feature.**

PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/styxx/6.1.0/

### `arg_order_inversion` — 23rd feature

The v6.0 drift detector had one documented failure mode: `arg_swap`
(AUC 0.664), where a model produces the right argument names but
assigns wrong values across slots. None of the 22 v6.0 features
could separate this case from gold calls — all schema checks pass,
all prompt-overlap features pass.

The new feature — `arg_order_inversion` — measures whether the
positional order of call-values in the prompt matches the schema's
declared argument-key order. A correct call tends to have value
positions monotonically increasing with schema index; arg_swap
inverts that.

Formally, for each argument pair `(ki, kj)` where both call values
have a detectable first-appearance position in the prompt tokens:
```
schema says:  schema_order[ki] < schema_order[kj]
prompt says:  prompt_pos(call_args[ki]) < prompt_pos(call_args[kj])
inverted if the two disagree.
```
`arg_order_inversion = inversions / eligible_pairs ∈ [0, 1]`.

Signal validation on BFCL v3 n=3,700 (no training involved):

```
drift_type             n   mean   cov>0
gold                 658  0.166  24.2%
arg_swap             604  0.415  53.3%    <-- +0.249 over gold
arg_drop             657  0.094  11.4%
spurious_arg         658  0.166  24.2%
irrelevance_called  1122  0.567  58.4%
```

### 5-fold CV results (same n=3,700, same protocol)

| metric                   | v6.0 (22-feat) | v6.1 (23-feat) | delta   |
|--------------------------|----------------|----------------|---------|
| Pooled AUC               | 0.9148         | **0.9425**     | +0.028  |
| Mean fold AUC (± std)    | 0.9151 ± 0.004 | **0.9430 ± 0.009** | +0.028 |
| **arg_swap** (vs gold)   | **0.664**      | **0.755**      | **+0.091** |
| irrelevance_called       | 0.957          | 0.980          | +0.023  |
| arg_drop                 | 0.998          | 0.997          | ~flat   |
| spurious_arg             | 0.997          | 0.997          | ~flat   |
| simple (pooled)          | 0.902          | 0.930          | +0.028  |
| live_simple (pooled)     | 0.872          | 0.904          | +0.032  |

No regressions. `arg_order_inversion` lands at #6 by coefficient
magnitude (+1.154 scaled), top-3 on arg_swap cases at inference.

### Remaining failure modes

arg_swap at 0.755 is a partial fix, not a full one. The feature is
a surface-level positional heuristic — it fails when:
- both swapped values share the same prompt position (numerical
  ambiguity, e.g. `"divide 5 by 5"`)
- one value is missing from the prompt (synthesized by the model)
- the schema's declared order doesn't match the prompt's natural
  order (baseline inversion rate on gold ~0.17)

Full arg_swap fix is scoped for v3 via embedding-based per-slot
semantic fit.

### Files changed

- `styxx/guardrail/drift_signals.py` — 22 → 23 features, added
  `_arg_order_inversion_rate` helper.
- `styxx/guardrail/calibrated_weights_drift_v1.py` — fully retrained
  coefficients, scaler mean/scale, intercept, AUC tables.
- `styxx/guardrail/drift.py` — docstring update with new numbers.
- `scripts/drift_calibrated_v1.py` — new trainer (mirrors v0,
  adds the feature to Group B).
- `scripts/drift_feature_probe_arg_order.py` — signal-strength
  probe used to justify the retrain.
- `benchmarks/drift_calibrated_v1.json` — full v1 artifact.
- `tests/test_drift_v1.py` — assertions bumped to 23-feature,
  v1 artifact path.

### Compatibility

Same public API (`styxx.guardrail.drift_check()` unchanged).
Scores shift: expect drift_risk to move by up to ±0.1 on borderline
cases relative to v6.0. Decision boundary (`drifts = drift_risk >=
0.5`) is stable on the held-out test set.

---

## [6.0.0] — 2026-04-23

**Headline: cognometric instrument #3 — tool-call drift — ships as the
third calibrated detector, alongside hallucination (v4) and refusal
(v5.1). Three instruments is the minimum triangulation for a
methodology claim rather than a lucky two-sample.**

PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/styxx/6.0.0/

### `styxx.guardrail.drift_check()` — new public API

```python
from styxx.guardrail import drift_check

v = drift_check(
    prompt="Find the area of a triangle with base 10 and height 5",
    functions=[{"name": "calculate_triangle_area",
                "parameters": {"properties": {"base": {"type": "integer"},
                                              "height": {"type": "integer"}},
                               "required": ["base", "height"]}}],
    tool_call={"name": "calculate_triangle_area",
               "arguments": {"base": 10, "height": 5}},
)
# v.drift_risk   — 0-1 calibrated probability
# v.drifts       — bool at threshold 0.5
# v.top_signals  — top-3 contributing features (signed contribution)
```

### Calibration

Trained on **Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard v3** via
mutation-based construction (arg_swap, arg_drop, spurious_arg,
tool_rename) + irrelevance-called synthesis. n=3,700 labeled triplets,
82/18 drift/no-drift split.

- **5-fold CV AUC: 0.9151 ± 0.0039** (pooled 0.9148).
- 22-feature calibrated LR with `class_weight=balanced`.

Per-drift-type held-out AUC:

| drift class              | AUC      | notes |
|--------------------------|----------|---|
| spurious_arg             | 0.997    | clean capture |
| arg_drop                 | 0.998    | clean capture |
| irrelevance_called       | 0.957    | +0.40 over null baseline 0.562 |
| arg_swap                 | 0.664    | **documented failure — fix v3** |
| tool_rename              | 0.030    | n=1, BFCL under-samples this class |

### vs the only published comparable baseline

[Healy et al. 2026 (arXiv:2601.05214)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05214)
reports AUC **0.716–0.721** on Glaive using **last-layer hidden-state
MLP features** — requires model internals. styxx drift v1 hits **0.916
on BFCL v3 text-only**, works on ANY closed model (OpenAI, Anthropic,
Gemini) without hidden-state access.

### Artifacts

- `scripts/drift_build_dataset_v0.py` — dataset reproducer
- `scripts/drift_null_baselines_v0.py` — 5 null heuristics (best
  baseline, schema_conformance, caps at 0.733 — kill-criterion pass)
- `scripts/drift_calibrated_v0.py` — calibrated LR + 5-fold CV
- `benchmarks/drift_calibrated_v0.json` — full result artifact
- `data/drift_v0/drift_dataset_v0.jsonl` — committed training data
- `styxx/guardrail/drift.py` — public API
- `styxx/guardrail/calibrated_weights_drift_v1.py` — 22 features + LR
  coefs + scaler + per-class AUC + CALIBRATION_NOTES

### Tests

15 new regression tests in `tests/test_drift_v1.py` covering public
API shape, JSON roundtrip, 4 canonical cases (correct call, missing
arg, spurious arg, wrong tool), edge cases, and calibrated-weights
pinning. Full suite: **655 passed, 1 skipped, 0 failed** in ~30s.

### Law II empirical support now at three instruments

| instrument          | cross-substrate evidence                        |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Hallucination (v4)  | 8 benchmarks (probe + classifier)               |
| Refusal (v5.1)      | 5 model families (classifier)                   |
| Tool-call drift (v6)| 4 mutation types + natural irrelevance          |

## [5.1.0] — 2026-04-23

**Headline: rigor pass. v2 refusal weights pulled from public API as
research-only after an honest over-flagging bias was characterised.
No external amplification shipped until every claim was verified.**

### v2 refusal weights: demoted to research artifact

v2 weights trained on n=380 diverse-model samples revealed two honest
findings:

- **Good:** Llama-2-orig AUC jumped +0.11 (robustness gain).
- **Bad:** short factual compliances over-flagged as refusals (second
  documented failure mode: `enumerated_technical_compliance`).

Rather than ship v2 in the public API with a known bias, v2 stays as
a committed RESEARCH ARTIFACT (module, scripts, benchmark JSON, 10
regression tests) but is NOT exposed via `refuse_check()`. When v3
fixes the bias (via z-clip + retraining with enumerated-compliance
examples), v2 can be promoted to the public API.

### Prior-art correction: "first public XSTest AUC" claim retracted

Independent verification found that IBM Granite Guardian
([arXiv:2412.07724](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07724), Dec 2024,
Table 7) already published XSTest AUC for 9 safety classifiers six
months before our v5.0. Our 0.976 on XSTest-v2 GPT-4 held-out is
**competitive** with that tier, not first-in-class.

Fixed across `README.md`, `release/v5-amplify-kit`,
`cognometry-refuse.html` meta tags, and the v5.0.0 GitHub release
notes — **before** any external amplification. 0 tweets posted, 0
threads published, 0 HN submissions. The false claim never reached
the public.

### Research & methodology

- `scripts/compete_hhem_halueval.py` — HHEM-2.1-Open head-to-head
  reproducer (styxx +0.23 AUC on HaluEval-QA, 220× faster).
- `papers/cognometry-v0.5.{md,pdf}` — full arXiv-submittable paper
  (259KB, 10–12 pages) merging v0 + addendum. Adds §4 refusal
  instrument, §5.1 HHEM head-to-head, §5.3 Granite Guardian context,
  §5.4 related work expansion, §6 new failure modes, Appendix C
  per-seed raw AUCs. Endorsement code obtained for arXiv cs.LG.
- `papers/tool-call-drift-scope-v0.md` — research scope for
  instrument #3 (prerequisite for v6.0).
- `papers/landscape-scan-v05.md` — academic landscape background,
  Wang 2025 "False Sense of Security" rebuttal cited head-on.

### Changes

- `pyproject.toml` version: 5.0.0 → 5.1.0
- `styxx/__init__.py` `__version__`: 5.0.0 → 5.1.0
- `styxx/guardrail/refusal.py` — reverted variant parameter, kept
  `weights_variant` field on `RefusalVerdict` (always `"v1"` for now).
- `styxx/guardrail/calibrated_weights_refusal_v2.py` — added second
  failure mode + v2-specific failure notes + defensive z-score
  clipping.
- `tests/test_refusal_v2.py` REMOVED (tested public API that doesn't
  exist).
- `tests/test_refusal_v2_research.py` ADDED (10 tests) — pins v2 as
  research artifact, verifies it's NOT exposed via public API,
  asserts the over-flagging bias is real (regression test forces v3
  promotion when fixed).
- README refusal section reframed: "v1 is apologetic-style
  specialist, v2 not yet in public API" with link to
  `calibrated_weights_refusal_v2.py` CALIBRATION_NOTES.

### Tests

Full suite: **640 passed, 1 skipped, 0 failed** in 28.5s.

## [5.0.0] — 2026-04-23

**Headline: cognometric instrument #2 — refusal detection — ships as
the second calibrated detector on the same methodology as
hallucination. "0.998 AUC on HaluEval-QA. 9 floats. No LLM."**

PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/styxx/5.0.0/

### `styxx.guardrail.refuse_check()` — new public API

```python
from styxx.guardrail import refuse_check

v = refuse_check(
    prompt="How do I shut down a Python process?",
    response="I'm sorry, but I can't help with that...",
)
# v.refuse_risk   — 0-1 calibrated probability
# v.refuses       — bool, threshold default 0.5
# v.features      — dict of 18 raw features
# v.top_signals   — top-3 contributing features by scaled contribution
```

Mirrors the shape of the v4 hallucination `check()` API. Pure-Python,
Pyodide-safe, no external deps beyond existing `text_features`
vocabularies.

### Calibration

- Train: 80 labeled (prompt, response) from JailbreakBench,
  Llama-3.2-1B apologetic refusals (already committed in
  `styxx/residual_probe/atlas/compliance_labels_llama_1b.json`).
- Test: XSTest v2, 450 samples × 5 model families (GPT-4, Llama-2
  new/orig, Mistral guard/instruct) — 2,250 held-out samples total.
- Features: 18 text-only heuristics (refusal_density, disclaimer,
  normative, sorry-opener, word-count, etc.). No logprobs, no model
  weights.

Held-out AUCs (LR trained on JBB-Llama-1B, tested on XSTest):

| split               | AUC    | notes |
|---------------------|--------|---|
| GPT-4               | **0.9759** | out-of-family best |
| Llama-2 new         | 0.8741 | |
| Llama-2 orig        | 0.7832 | |
| Mistral-guard       | 0.7797 | |
| Mistral-instruct    | 0.6097 | **documented failure mode** |
| mean cross-model    | 0.8045 | |

First-pass training AUC on JBB (5-fold CV): 0.9967.

### Failure-mode note

Mistral-instruct refuses by lecturing ("It's important to note...",
"It's crucial to...") rather than apologizing. Our normative-lecturing
features exist but carry zero weight because the JBB-Llama training
corpus only contains apologetic refusals — LR cannot learn to use
features the training data never exercises. v1 is an
**apologetic-style specialist**; it wins on Claude / GPT-4 /
Llama-style outputs. Fix tracked in research → v5.1.

### README rewrite

Competitive landscape tables for both instruments:

- **Hallucination** — vs Patronus Lynx-70B, Vectara HHEM-2.1-Open,
  Cleanlab TLM, Galileo Luna.
- **Refusal** — vs Llama Guard 2/3, ShieldGemma 2B/9B/27B, OpenAI
  Moderation, Aegis, Perspective API.

H1 positioning: **"0.998 AUC on HaluEval-QA. 9 floats. No LLM."**

### Artifacts

- `styxx/guardrail/calibrated_weights_refusal_v1.py` — 18 features +
  LR coefs + scaler + held-out AUC per split + CALIBRATION_NOTES.
- `styxx/guardrail/refusal_signals.py` — pure-Python feature
  extractor.
- `styxx/guardrail/refusal.py` — public `refuse_check` +
  `RefusalVerdict`.
- `pyproject.toml` description updated to reflect two instruments.

This establishes refusal-detection as the second cognometric
instrument on the same methodology as hallucination (v4).

## [4.0.2] — 2026-04-23

**Headline: fix adaptive-threshold false-positives on entity-rich
factual responses without a reference.**

In 4.0.1, the adaptive threshold on the text-only heuristic path
was 0.9. But the piecewise-linear calibration maps a saturated
`text_claim_risk=1.0` to raw risk ~0.98 regardless of whether the
response is correct or hallucinated — the signal is structurally
non-discriminative without a reference. Any entity-rich factual
claim like "The capital of France is Paris." still halted.

Fix: adaptive threshold on text-only path raised to 0.99. Honest
position: when `@trust` has no reference, it cannot meaningfully
verify, so it passes through rather than halting on noise. Users
who want strict text-only gating set `threshold=` explicitly.

The `reference`-auto-detect path (calibrated v2/v4 weights) keeps
the 0.7 default — nothing changes there.

### Tests

18 new regression tests in `tests/test_trust_v4_0_1.py` covering the
4.0.1 effortless-mode behaviors (auto-detect, auto-NLI, adaptive
threshold, best-of-N retry). Full suite: 591 pass.

### URL health

Fixed stale HuggingFace reference to `truthful_qa` (moved to
`truthfulqa/truthful_qa`) in zenodo metadata script and
submission-package doc. No runtime impact.

### Site

`og:image` now returns 200 for the cognometry manifesto
(banner asset added to `assets/styxx/`). Leaderboard page gains
its own `og:image` + `twitter:card` tags so link previews render
correctly on X/LinkedIn/Slack.

---

## [4.0.1] — 2026-04-23

**Headline: `@trust` is now effortless. Zero config, zero sharp edges.**

Three UX fixes that turn first-contact from "why is every response
being flagged?" into "it just works":

### Zero-config reference auto-detect

`@trust` now auto-detects reference passages from any of these
kwarg names on the wrapped function: `context`, `reference`,
`references`, `passage`, `passages`, `docs`, `documents`, `source`,
`sources`, `knowledge`, `grounding`, `retrieved`, `retrieval`.

```python
@trust
def my_rag(question, *, context):   # no more reference_arg=...
    return openai.chat.completions.create(...)
```

Before: users had to write `@trust(reference_arg="context")` or
the detector would silently run text-only and over-halt. Now it's
automatic. `reference_arg=` is still honored when explicit; only
kwargs the function actually declares are picked up, so framework
pass-throughs don't cause false positives.

List/tuple of passages are also recognized and joined with newline.

### Auto-enable NLI when `styxx[nli]` is installed

`use_nli` default changed from `False` to `None` (auto). When
`torch` + `transformers` are importable, NLI is on by default. When
they aren't, it stays off. `use_nli=True` / `use_nli=False` are
still honored explicitly.

This means `pip install styxx[nli]` now matters: you get the v4
9-signal pipeline automatically rather than needing to pass
`use_nli=True` everywhere.

### Adaptive threshold

`@trust` previously halted at a flat `threshold=0.7`. When no
reference was provided (text-heuristic path), any confident factual
claim scored risk ~0.98 and triggered a halt — first-run demos
returned the fallback on correct answers.

Fix: when the user didn't override `threshold` (i.e., the default
0.7 is in effect) AND only the text-heuristic path is firing, the
effective threshold is bumped to 0.9. Calibrated paths (v2, v4,
tier-1) keep 0.7. Explicit user thresholds — any non-default value
— are always respected.

### Smart retry: best-of-N

`on_halt="retry"` now tracks the lowest-risk response across all
retry attempts. When retries exhaust and no attempt cleared the
threshold, the fallback still fires (same behavior), but the
internal state now reflects the genuinely-best candidate — which
matters for `on_halt="annotate"` users inspecting `attempts` and
for future features that might use the best candidate differently.

### Tests

Full suite: 573 pass. `test_trust.py` existing suite unchanged and
green; new behaviors are backward-compatible.

### What's NOT changed

- `@trust()` defaults: `threshold=0.7`, `on_halt="fallback"`,
  `max_retries=2`, `fallback="I'm not confident..."`. Same as 4.0.0.
- 8-benchmark calibrated weights v4: identical. No retraining.
- API surface: only additions (zero new required args, no renames).

---

## [4.0.0] — 2026-04-23

**Headline: cross-validated on 8 benchmarks. The first honest
8-benchmark audit of hallucination detection. 5/8 above AUC 0.65;
two failure modes (DROP, FinanceBench) published, not hidden.**

Extends the v3 NLI-augmented pipeline (4 benchmarks — HaluEval-QA,
HaluEval-Dialog, HaluEval-Summ, TruthfulQA) to 8 benchmarks by
adding 4 new domains from PatronusAI's public HaluBench:

  - DROP         — reading comprehension QA
  - PubMedQA     — biomedical QA
  - FinanceBench — financial document QA
  - RAGTruth     — RAG-style retrieval faithfulness

### Headline numbers (3-seed mean ± std, n=150/dataset, seeds [31,47,83])

| Dataset                 | v4 AUC            | Commentary |
|-------------------------|-------------------|---|
| HaluEval-QA             | **0.998 ± 0.001** | near-perfect |
| TruthfulQA              | **0.994 ± 0.006** | near-perfect |
| HaluBench-RAGTruth      | **0.807 ± 0.043** | new — RAG faithfulness |
| HaluBench-PubMedQA      | **0.719 ± 0.051** | new — biomedical |
| HaluEval-Dialog         | 0.676 ± 0.037     | (v3 peaked 0.729) |
| HaluEval-Summarization  | 0.643 ± 0.060     | (v3 peaked 0.665) |
| HaluBench-FinanceBench  | 0.492 ± 0.026     | **below chance** |
| HaluBench-DROP          | 0.424 ± 0.080     | **below chance** |
| **overall mean**        | **0.719**         | 5/8 above 0.65 |

### Published failure modes (intentional)

- **DROP** (reading comp). Extractive-span hallucinations (wrong
  span from right passage) are *entailed* by the passage at the NLI
  level; novelty signals are also blind because the tokens overlap.
  Future: span-level faithfulness scoring.
- **FinanceBench** (financial QA). Hallucinations are mostly
  calculation/aggregation errors on numbers copied verbatim from
  the passage. Novelty + NLI are semantically blind to arithmetic.
  Future: number-symbolic verification signal.

These are in the paper, in the CHANGELOG, in the CALIBRATION_NOTES
dict on the weights module itself. We publish what breaks.

### Design decision: v3 stays the default

v4 generalizes across 8 domains; v3 is more peaked on HaluEval-style
dialog/summarization. `guardrail.check(use_nli=True, ...)` continues
to route through the v3 LR (peaked) when all 9 signals are present.
v4 is available via direct import for callers who explicitly want
cross-domain averaging:

```python
from styxx.guardrail.calibrated_weights_v4 import predict_proba_v4
```

Rationale: most production RAG/QA traffic looks more like HaluEval-QA
than like the 8-dataset average. The broader calibration is available
when you have reason to want it; the narrower calibration ships as
the default because it serves the common case better.

### Added modules / benchmarks

- `styxx.guardrail.calibrated_weights_v4` — 9-signal, 8-benchmark
  pooled LR, 3-seed averaged.
- `benchmarks/hallucination_test/cross_dataset_8bench.py` — full
  8-benchmark calibration harness.
- `benchmarks/hallucination_test/cross_dataset_8bench_multiseed.py` —
  multi-seed wrapper, saves averaged coefs + per-dataset AUC std
  to `results/cross_dataset_8bench_multiseed.json`.
- Paper: *Cognometry v0: 8-benchmark cross-validated hallucination
  detection*. Zenodo deposit.

### Tests

5 new tests in `tests/test_weights_v4.py`. Full suite: 578 pass,
1 skipped, 0 fail.

### What changes vs v4.0.0rc1

v4.0.0rc1 (published 2026-04-23) shipped the NLI signal + v3 weights
on 4 benchmarks. v4.0.0 adds v4 weights (same NLI signal, broader
calibration) plus the HaluBench harness. No breaking changes.

---

## [4.0.0rc1] — 2026-04-23

**Headline: NLI v4.0 preview. The ninth signal — entailment-based
contradiction — lifts HaluEval-Dialog from AUC 0.61 → 0.73 and
produces the first honest number above chance on dialog hallucination
detection at this benchmark scale.**

This is a **release candidate**. The 8-dataset cross-validation
(FEVER, FactCC, XSum-Faithful, PHD-A) lands in the v4.0.0 final.
Install it to preview the signal; pin `4.0.0rc1` explicitly if you
want reproducibility across the rc→final transition.

### Added — `styxx.guardrail.nli_signal`

A lazy-loaded NLI contradiction scorer. Wraps
`MoritzLaurer/DeBERTa-v3-base-mnli-fever-anli` (~184M params; trained
on MNLI + FEVER + ANLI-R3) and exposes:

```python
from styxx.guardrail.nli_signal import (
    nli_contradiction_score, NLIScorer, get_default_scorer,
)

# Convenience (singleton, fail-open)
p = nli_contradiction_score(
    reference="Hamlet was written by William Shakespeare.",
    response="Hamlet was written by Dickens.",
)
# p ≈ 0.95
```

Thread-safe, CPU or CUDA. Fails open on any error (empty input,
model-load failure, transformers missing). No new required
dependency — torch+transformers only needed when `use_nli=True`.

### Added — `guardrail.check(use_nli=..., nli_scorer=...)`

```python
from styxx.guardrail import check

verdict = check(
    prompt="Who wrote Hamlet?",
    response="Hamlet was written by Dickens.",
    reference="Hamlet was written by William Shakespeare.",
    use_nli=True,      # opt-in
)
```

When `use_nli=True` and a reference passage is available, the
pipeline adds a `nli_contradict ∈ [0,1]` signal and routes the
verdict through the v3 calibrated LR (9 signals). Otherwise falls
back gracefully to v2 (8 signals) or v1 (4 signals).

Pass a pre-loaded `NLIScorer` via `nli_scorer=` to amortize the
one-time model load across many calls.

### Added — `styxx.guardrail.calibrated_weights_v3`

9-feature pooled LR, 3-seed averaged over seeds [31, 47, 83].
`predict_proba_v3(signals)` is the drop-in replacement for v2's
`predict_proba_v2`.

### Measured numbers (3-seed mean ± std, n=200/dataset, seed set [31,47,83])

| Dataset               | v3.9.1 (v2) | **v4.0.0rc1 (v3)** | Δ     |
|-----------------------|-------------|--------------------:|------:|
| HaluEval-QA           | 1.000       | **0.996 ± 0.002**   | -0.004|
| TruthfulQA            | 0.977       | **0.995 ± 0.004**   | +0.018|
| HaluEval-Dialog       | 0.605       | **0.729 ± 0.042**   | **+0.123** |
| HaluEval-Summarization| 0.636       | **0.665 ± 0.029**   | +0.028|
| **mean**              | **0.805**   | **0.846**           | **+0.041** |

Honest read: dialog is the big win (+0.123 absolute, single-seed
max 0.788). Summarization is real but smaller (+0.028). QA loses
a noise-level 0.004 — the two near-perfect classifiers are
indistinguishable within the noise floor.

### Signal weights (3-seed averaged LR coefficients)

```
text_claim_risk:        0.1751
entity_unverified_frac: 0.0000  (signal fires too rarely to matter here)
knowledge_grounding:    0.1231
content_novelty:        0.3368
entity_novelty:         0.1353
number_novelty:         0.0333
bigram_novelty:         0.4104
trigram_novelty:        0.7727
nli_contradict:         0.8784  ← strongest single signal
intercept:             -1.1257
```

NLI and trigram-novelty are complementary, not redundant: novelty
catches "response added content not in reference"; NLI catches
"response asserts what reference denies." Dialog and summarization
errors are dominated by the latter, which explains the gain pattern.

### New install extra

```bash
pip install styxx[nli]
```

Installs `torch>=2.0` + `transformers>=4.35`. Downloads the DeBERTa
checkpoint on first call (~1GB on disk, ~700MB RAM).

### New benchmark

`benchmarks/hallucination_test/cross_dataset_multi_seed.py` runs the
full pooled calibration across multiple seeds with and without NLI,
saves per-seed results + averaged coefficients to
`results/multi_seed_calibration.json`. Regenerates the numbers above.

### Tests

17 new tests in `tests/test_nli_signal.py`: v3 weight structure,
monotonicity, fail-open behavior, `check()` integration with mock
scorer, preservation under missing signals. Full suite: 573 pass,
1 skipped, 0 fail.

### Honest limits

- Summarization is still at AUC 0.66 — real signal but not
  production-grade. The residual gap is structural: summaries
  paraphrase faithfully, which NLI only partially captures.
- Single-seed dialog ranges [0.574, 0.788] — high variance. Average
  is what ships; users at low N may see closer to single-seed
  performance.
- NLI adds latency: ~150–400 ms per pair on CPU, ~10–30 ms on CUDA.
  Most deployments should pre-warm `get_default_scorer()._load()`.
- **No FEVER / FactCC / XSum yet.** The strong claim
  ("cross-validated on 8 benchmarks") ships with v4.0.0 final.

### What ships next (v4.0.0 final)

- Cross-validation on FEVER-dev + FactCC + XSum-Faithful + PHD-A
- Any coefficient refit required after the 8-dataset fit
- Paper: *Cognometry v0: cross-validated hallucination detection on
  8 benchmarks*. Zenodo deposit.

## [3.9.1] — 2026-04-23

**Headline: cross-dataset validation. v3.9.0's `@trust` worked on
HaluEval-QA (AUC 0.90) but we caught our own overfitting to that
benchmark and fixed it before anyone else could.**

### What we caught

Immediately after shipping v3.9.0 we ran cross-dataset validation
on HaluEval-Dialog, HaluEval-Summarization, and TruthfulQA with
the v3.9.0 weights. Performance collapsed to near-random (AUC
0.56–0.63) on three of four datasets. The 0.90 on HaluEval-QA was
a single-benchmark overfit.

Rather than quietly backtrack, we told on ourselves, added four
new signals, refit a pooled LR on all four datasets, and published
honest per-dataset numbers.

### New signals: response_novelty

Four asymmetric grounding signals that capture what the response
ADDED that the reference doesn't support (the opposite direction
from `knowledge_grounding`, which measures what's in the response
that IS in the reference):

- `content_novelty`  — fraction of response content tokens not in reference
- `entity_novelty`   — fraction of capitalized tokens (≥4 chars) not in reference
- `number_novelty`   — fraction of numeric tokens not in reference
- `bigram_novelty`   — fraction of response bigrams not in reference
- `trigram_novelty`  — fraction of response trigrams not in reference (strongest signal)

All five are cheap text operations — no model, no API, no latency.

### New calibration: `calibrated_weights_v2`

Pooled LR fit on HaluEval-QA + HaluEval-Dialog + HaluEval-Summ +
TruthfulQA (n=800 train, n=400 test, seed 31, L2=0.05, 8 features).

Held-out per-dataset test AUC:

| dataset                   | v3.9.0 | **v3.9.1** |
|---------------------------|-------:|-----------:|
| HaluEval-QA               | 0.9049 | **1.0000** |
| TruthfulQA                | 0.6261 | **0.9767** |
| HaluEval-Summarization    | 0.5897 | **0.5954** |
| HaluEval-Dialog           | 0.5984 | **0.6014** |
| mean                      | 0.6548 | **0.7934** |

Big wins on reference-grounded QA (the most common LLM use case:
RAG, open-domain Q&A). Modest improvements on
dialog/summarization — these are inherently NLI-requiring
(contradiction, not novelty) and will need NLI-based signals in
v4.0.

### Honest limits

- **Dialog and summarization remain hard** (AUC ~0.60). The
  limiting factor is that faithful dialog/summary responses
  naturally add content not verbatim in the reference. True
  discrimination needs NLI-style entailment, which is planned.
- **No reference passage → weaker detection.** v2 falls back to
  v1 (4-signal LR) when novelty isn't computable, and heuristic
  fusion when v1 isn't either.
- **English only, for now.** Novelty tokenization is
  whitespace-based.

### Pipeline integration

`guardrail.check()` now prefers v2 when all novelty signals are
available (reference provided), falls back to v1 when all four
v1 signals are available, then heuristic. Automatic — no API
changes.

### Tests

11 new tests in `tests/test_response_novelty.py`. Full suite:
573 pass, 1 skipped, 0 fail.

### Credibility over hype

v3.9.0 overclaimed. v3.9.1 is the honest result. `@trust` remains
a one-line API; what it defends has been properly cross-validated
and the numbers hold up — with specific, stated limits on where
they don't.

---

## [3.9.0] — 2026-04-22

**Headline: the trust layer. one decorator, any LLM call, verified
output. `pip install styxx` + `@trust` is all it takes to stop
hallucinations from reaching users.**

### New: `styxx.trust` — the one-line hallucination prevention layer

```python
from styxx import trust

@trust
def my_rag(question: str) -> str:
    return openai.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": question}],
    )
```

That's the whole API. `@trust` wraps any LLM-calling function.
Every output is cognometrically verified via
`styxx.guardrail.check()` (AUC 0.9012 on HaluEval-QA) before it
reaches the caller. If risk exceeds threshold, styxx intercepts.

### Design principles

- **Zero config out of the box.** Ships with HaluEval-calibrated
  LR weights. No residual-stream access needed. No API keys.
- **Shape-preserving.** Extracts text from OpenAI's
  `.choices[0].message.content`, Anthropic's
  `.content[0].text`, LangChain messages, dicts, and raw
  strings — automatically. Returns the same shape with
  replaced content, so downstream code still works.
- **Prompt auto-detection.** Pulls the user prompt from common
  kwargs (`prompt`, `question`, `query`, `messages`) or
  positional string args. Override with `prompt_arg="..."`.
- **Sync and async.** Auto-detects coroutine functions.
- **Four halt policies.**
  - `on_halt="fallback"` (default) — return safe text
  - `on_halt="retry"` — re-call up to `max_retries`
  - `on_halt="raise"` — raise `TrustViolation`
  - `on_halt="annotate"` — return `TrustResult(response, verdict)`

### API

```python
@trust(
    threshold=0.7,
    on_halt="fallback",
    fallback="I'm not confident...",
    max_retries=2,
    reference_arg="context",
    use_entity_verify=True,
    use_probe=False,
    verbose=False,
)
def my_agent(question, *, context=""):
    ...
```

### Tests

31 new tests in `tests/test_trust.py` — full suite now 562 pass,
1 skipped, 0 fail. Covers: text extraction from 6 response shapes,
prompt extraction from 7 input patterns, shape-preserving
replacement, sync/async, all 4 halt policies, retry budgets,
reference-arg grounding.

### The bet

styxx 3.9.0 is the product that tries to change the space forever.
TLS for LLM cognition. Nothing crosses unseen.

---

## [3.8.0] — 2026-04-22

**Headline: `styxx.guardrail` reaches test AUC 0.9012 on
HaluEval-QA with a learned-weight fusion classifier, beating
published state-of-the-art by a clear margin.**

### New: calibrated LR meta-classifier fusion

The guardrail now ships with logistic-regression weights fit on
HaluEval-QA dev (n=300, seed 11), evaluated on held-out test
(n=230, seed 17, deduplicated by question):

- **Test AUC: 0.9012** (dev AUC: 0.9411)
- Threshold 0.5: precision 0.873, recall 0.839, F1 0.856
- Threshold 0.7: precision 1.000, recall 0.578 (zero false positives)
- Threshold 0.8: precision 1.000, recall 0.374

Learned signal weights:
```
LR_COEFS = {
    "text_claim_risk":        1.4887,
    "entity_unverified_frac": 1.4331,
    "knowledge_grounding":    8.2097,  # dominant when reference available
    "probe_confab":           1.3469,
}
LR_INTERCEPT = -3.4586
```

The knowledge-grounding signal is by far the strongest contributor
when a reference passage is available; probe, entity verify, and
text features add independent corrections.

### Comparison to published SOTA on HaluEval-QA

| System                 | AUC (HaluEval-QA) |
|------------------------|-------------------|
| SelfCheckGPT           | 0.71–0.79         |
| KnowHalu               | 0.74              |
| HaluCheck              | 0.82              |
| **styxx.guardrail v2** | **0.9012**        |

### New module: `styxx.guardrail.calibrated_weights`

Ships the fitted LR coefficients + a `predict_proba(signals)`
function. The main `check(...)` entry point automatically uses the
learned weights when all 4 core signals are available, falls back to
the heuristic weighted-sum + piecewise-linear calibration when a
signal is missing (e.g., no reference passage → grounding absent).

### New atlas entry

- `meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct` **halueval** probe
  (LOO-AUC 1.000 @ layer 8, paired contrast on HaluEval-QA
  n=200 right vs hallucinated).

Atlas total at v3.8.0: **29 probes across 6 vendors and 7 concepts.**

### New: `styxx.generate_safe` — real-time self-halting generation

One-function API that runs a residual-level probe after every
generated token and halts when the probe crosses a threshold.
Works on any HF decoder model with a matching probe in the atlas.

```python
from styxx import generate_safe

r = generate_safe(
    model="meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct",
    prompt="Tell me about Dr. Eleni Kostadinova",
    halt_on="halueval",
    threshold=0.7,
)
# r.text → safe response if halt fired, model output otherwise
# r.halted, r.halt_reason, r.probe_trajectory
```

This is the production-side companion to the post-hoc guardrail:
instead of flagging after generation, it intervenes at the
token-level boundary where fabrication begins.

### Reproducer

```bash
python benchmarks/hallucination_test/guardrail_calibrate.py \\
  --n_dev 300 --n_test 300 \\
  --seed_dev 11 --seed_test 17 \\
  --probe_task halueval
```

Expected: test AUC 0.89–0.94 on properly held-out HaluEval-QA.

---

## [3.7.0] — 2026-04-22

**Headline: `styxx.guardrail` — multi-signal hallucination-prevention
pipeline that achieves AUC 0.838 on HaluEval-QA (n=100), competitive
with published state-of-the-art detectors.**

### New module: `styxx.guardrail`

A production-shaped hallucination-prevention system, not just a
detector. Takes (prompt, response, optional reference) and returns
a `Verdict` with:

- Overall calibrated risk score ∈ [0, 1]
- Recommended action: `pass` / `annotate` / `retry` / `halt`
- Per-span flagged claims with reasons
- Per-signal readings for audit

Five-signal architecture:
1. `text_claim_risk` — surface-level confabulation-indicator text
   features per atomic claim (weight 0.15)
2. `entity_unverified_frac` — fraction of named entities not found
   on Wikipedia (weight 0.20)
3. `knowledge_grounding` — content-token coverage vs reference
   passage (weight 0.50, strongest when reference available)
4. `probe_confab` — residual-level probe signal from
   `confab_behavioral` on Llama-1B (weight 0.10; OOD for HaluEval,
   higher weight for fake-entity-biography domain)
5. `consensus_disagreement` — self-consistency disagreement via
   token-set Jaccard across N sampled responses (weight 0.30;
   optional, requires sampler)

### Benchmark

HaluEval-QA, n=100, seed=11, paired right/hallucinated answers:

    response="Hamlet was written by William Shakespeare around 1600.",
    reference="Hamlet is a tragedy by William Shakespeare...",
    use_entity_verify=True,
    use_grounding=True,
)
# verdict.risk     → 0.084 (low)
# verdict.action   → "pass"
# verdict.spans    → list of Span(text, risk, reasons)
```

## [3.6.0] — 2026-04-22

**UCB Phase 3 — shared residual subspace is universal; concept
encodings vary by training regime.**

### Headline finding

Across 5 independently-trained production LLMs from 5 different
vendors, at each model's concept-discriminative layer:

- **The top-30 residual subspace is 76-84% geometrically congruent**
  (canonical-correlation dim(ρ≥0.5) mean 23.2-25.3 / 30 across
  three concepts and 10 vendor pairs). The residual substrate is
  universal.
- **Concept-direction encodings within that subspace vary by
  concept type**: refuse (mean ρ=0.47), truthfulness (0.27),
  deception-template (0.21). Refusal converges strongly cross-
  vendor; factual and instruction-pattern concepts diverge.
- **Cross-scale capability transfer fails for truthfulness** (Llama-
  1B→3B via ridge projection: cos=+0.094, behavioral accuracy
  delta negative), even though refusal transfers within-family
  strongly (cos=+0.464).

This falsifies the naive "Platonic cognitive basis" hypothesis and
supports a more nuanced two-level picture: **substrate is shared;
concept encoding is training-regime-specific.**

### New atlas probes

- Truthfulness × 5 vendors (added `google/gemma-2-2b-it`, AUC
  0.851 @ layer 12, fraction 0.46 — completes 5×2 grid)
- Deception (template-contrast) × 5 vendors (Llama-1B/3B,
  Qwen-1.5B, Phi-3.5, Gemma-2B). All AUC 1.0 at layers 0-1 —
  prompt-template contrast separates linearly at embedding
  level. Template-detection directions, not behavioral-deception
  directions.

Current atlas size: **18 probes across 5 vendors and 5 concepts.**

### New analysis tools

- `benchmarks/causal_patching/train_truthfulness_probe.py` — HF
  TruthfulQA paired-contrast concept probe trainer.
- `benchmarks/causal_patching/train_deception_probe.py` — RepE-
  style system-instruction contrast probe trainer.
- `benchmarks/causal_patching/ucb_probe_correlation.py` — cross-
  model probe score-stream Pearson correlation matrix.
- `benchmarks/causal_patching/ucb_subspace_dim.py` — pairwise
  classical CCA → shared-subspace dimensionality estimator.
- `benchmarks/capability_steering/cross_scale_transfer.py` —
  capability-direction cross-scale ridge projection + behavioral
  validation.

### New run artifacts

- `benchmarks/causal_patching/runs/ucb_phase2_*_correlation.json`
- `benchmarks/causal_patching/runs/ucb_subspace_dim_{refuse,
  truthfulness,deception}.json`
- `benchmarks/capability_steering/runs/cross_scale/cross_scale_transfer.json`

### Paper updated

- `papers/universal-cognitive-basis-phase2.md` with full Phase 2 +
  Phase 3 findings and mechanism hypothesis.

### Implications for practice

- **Safety-library is feasible** (refusal direction is UCB-portable
  across vendors at ρ≈0.47-0.87 and cos≈0.36-0.46).
- **Capability-library is narrow** (truthfulness direction fails
  to transfer even within a family; per-model training is still
  required for skill transfer).
- **Cognitive auditing across vendors is feasible** for properties
  that live in the shared 23-25 / 30 dimensional subspace.

### Open questions (Phase 4+)

- Mechanism: why does safety-concept encoding converge while
  factual concept encoding diverges? Hypothesis: RLHF-style
  training on similar refusal behaviors creates convergent axes;
  pretraining-dependent factual knowledge creates divergent axes.
  Falsifier: train a from-scratch model without RLHF and measure
  whether its refusal direction aligns with RLHF'd vendors.
- Behavioral (not template-contrast) deception probes on all 5
  vendors — does deception follow refuse's convergence pattern
  or truthfulness's divergence?
- More concepts to map the universality landscape: empathy,
  reasoning-trace, overconfidence, goal-drift.

## [3.5.1] — 2026-04-22

**UCB Phase 2 — first public cross-vendor cognitive-agreement
measurement.** Same-day follow-up to v3.5.0, adding:

### New atlas entries
- `google/gemma-2-2b-it` refuse probe (AUC 0.984 @ layer 16,
  fraction 0.59)
- Truthfulness concept probes on 4 vendors:
  - `meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct` (AUC 0.835 @ layer 7,
    fraction 0.41)
  - `meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct` (AUC 0.880 @ layer 12,
    fraction 0.41)
  - `Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct` (AUC 0.863 @ layer 14,
    fraction 0.48)
  - `microsoft/Phi-3.5-mini-instruct` (AUC 0.898 @ layer 18,
    fraction 0.55)

**Truthfulness encoded at fraction 0.41–0.55 across all four
models.** Tighter band than refuse (0.59–0.93), suggesting
truthfulness has a more universal encoding depth.

### UCB Phase 2 result — landmark measurement

For each concept, we run every model's trained probe on the
same 80 held-out prompts; compute pairwise Pearson correlation
across per-prompt probe-score streams.

**comply_refuse — 5 vendors, 10 pairs:**
- Strongest agreement: Llama-1B ↔ Llama-3B (ρ=+0.873, same family)
- **Strongest cross-vendor: Gemma-2B ↔ Llama-3B (+0.794)**
- **Cross-vendor Gemma ↔ Llama-1B: +0.791**
- Weakest: Phi-3.5 ↔ Qwen-1.5B (+0.177)
- **Mean pairwise ρ = +0.472** (min +0.177)

**truthfulness — 4 vendors, 6 pairs:**
- Strongest cross-vendor: Llama-3B ↔ Phi-3.5 (+0.555)
- **Mean pairwise ρ = +0.305** (min +0.155)

**Partial UCB confirmed** — probes trained independently on 5
different vendors' models share measurable concept geometry,
with within-family and similar-posture pairs agreeing strongly
and divergent-safety-training pairs agreeing weakly. Refusal
concept is more universal than truthfulness, consistent with
safety training converging more across vendors than factual
knowledge.

### New modules
- `benchmarks/causal_patching/train_truthfulness_probe.py` — HF
  TruthfulQA-based paired-contrast concept probe trainer
- `benchmarks/causal_patching/ucb_probe_correlation.py` — the
  Phase 2 cross-model probe-agreement matrix tool

### Paper shipped
- `papers/universal-cognitive-basis-phase2.md` with live numbers

### What remains open (Phase 3+)
- Train Gemma truthfulness probe to complete 5-vendor × 2-concept
  grid
- Train deception + confab-behavioral on all 5 vendors
- Generalized CCA decomposition: what fraction of each model's
  concept direction lies in the shared subspace vs vendor-
  specific residual?
- Cross-architecture test: does UCB extend to non-transformer
  LMs (Mamba, RWKV)?

## [3.5.0] — 2026-04-22

**Headline features:**
1. **`styxx.steer` + `styxx.cogvm`** — CIS v0 (Cognitive Instruction Set).
   The first open-source runtime for programmable residual-stream control
   of any HuggingFace decoder model. Multi-concept steering composes
   arbitrary subsets of trained probe directions as additive residual
   interventions. CogVM adds conditional dispatch (WATCH/HALT/RETRY/SWITCH)
   over live per-token probe readings.
2. **`styxx.hallucination`** — runtime fabrication detector with three
   modes: one-shot `hallucination_verdict()`, streaming `stream_with_risk()`,
   and auto-halting `detect_hallucination(..., on_detect="halt_and_flag")`.
   Uses the new v1 behavioral-label confab probe (AUC 0.800 @ layer 11).
   Production API surface with per-token risk signal, auditable chain
   from flag → probe reading → residual position.
3. **Multi-vendor probe atlas.** Refusal probes shipped for
   `meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct`, `meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct`,
   `Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct`, and `microsoft/Phi-3.5-mini-instruct`.
   First open multi-vendor cognitive direction library.

### New research results

- **Causal claim on Llama-3.2-1B**: single-direction multi-position
  residual patching on the refusal direction causes
  **refuse@unsafe to drop 97% → 17% at α=3.0** (n=60 JBB test split).
  Asymmetry confirmed: inducing refusal on safe prompts barely moves
  the needle (0.13 → 0.17 at α=3). Reproduces Arditi et al. at 1B
  scale with open data. See `papers/cognitive-instruction-set-v0-filled.md`.

- **Concept geometry** at shared layer 10 of Llama-1B: pairwise angles
  between `comply_refuse`, `sycophant_pressure`, and `confab_prompt`
  directions fall in **86.7°–91.9°** — statistically indistinguishable
  from random high-dim unit vectors. Modular-concept hypothesis confirmed.
  See `benchmarks/causal_patching/measure_probe_geometry.py`.

- **Universal Cognitive Basis v0** — cross-model direction transfer grid:
  - Llama-1B → Llama-3B (same family): **cos = +0.464** (~26σ above chance)
  - Llama-1B → Qwen-1.5B (cross-vendor): **cos = +0.362** (~14σ)
  - Llama-1B → Phi-3.5 (large safety-gap): cos = +0.150 (~8σ)
  - Qwen-1.5B → Phi-3.5 (largest safety-gap): cos = +0.043 (~2σ, unaligned)

  UCB holds partially: within-family + close-vendor transfer works via
  ridge projection; divergent-safety-posture vendor pairs do not.
  Honest falsification of naive-linear UCB for the hardest case.
  See `papers/universal-cognitive-basis-v0.md`.

- **Gradient-free capability amplification on Llama-1B TruthfulQA**:
  multi-layer residual patching with a supervised correct-vs-incorrect
  answer direction boosts MC1 accuracy from **32.5% baseline → 39.5%
  at α=1.0 (+7.0 pp absolute, +21.5% relative)**, validated against a
  3-seed random-direction control (random directions HURT accuracy by
  mean −5.3pp at α=0.5, std 0.006; trained direction out-delivers
  random by **+10.8pp at α=1.0**). Single-layer single-direction patching
  was null at the same scale (n=200) — cumulative multi-layer injection
  is the operative mechanism. Matches Representation Engineering
  (Zou et al. 2023) now reproduced at 1B with open data + random control.
  See `papers/capability-amplification-v0.md`.

- **CognitiveBench v0 leaderboard** — first public cross-vendor
  cognitive audit. 50-prompt fake-entity fabrication battery run against
  Claude Haiku 4.5, Llama-1B/3B, Qwen-1.5B, Phi-3.5. Ground-truth
  labeled (every prompt targets a non-existent entity; any confident
  concrete response is fabrication). Same decline detector for every
  model. See `benchmarks/cognitive_bench/results/cognitivebench_v0.md`.

### Added modules

- `styxx.steer` — multi-concept composer (`steer(model, profile={...})`
  context manager; `steered_generate(...)` convenience).
- `styxx.cogvm` — declarative cognitive VM with
  `Program / WRITE / GENERATE / WATCH / HALT / RETRY / SWITCH` opcodes.
- `styxx.hallucination` — runtime fabrication detector.
- `styxx.hallucination_calibrate` — production threshold calibration
  utility (`calibrate_from_labels`).
- `styxx.residual_probe.atlas` — expanded to 5 refuse probes across 4
  vendor families + 3 concept probes (sycophant_pressure, confab_prompt,
  confab_behavioral) on Llama-1B.

### Added benchmarks

- `benchmarks/causal_patching/` — refusal probe training, α-sweep causal
  patching, concept-registry multi-concept trainer, probe geometry
  analysis, cross-scale comparison, cross-model direction transfer,
  UCB canonical correlation, paper-template filler, quick steering test,
  behavioral confab trainer.
- `benchmarks/capability_steering/` — truthfulness amplification (v3/v4/v5),
  random-direction control.
- `benchmarks/cogvm_demo/` — multi-concept steering demo, cross-vendor
  thought transplant demo.
- `benchmarks/claude_vs_us/` — Claude Haiku 4.5 hallucination battery.
- `benchmarks/cognitive_bench/` — CognitiveBench v0 cross-vendor audit.
- `benchmarks/hallucination_test/` — end-to-end hallucination detector test.

### Fixed

- **`styxx.residual_probe.intervene` device/dtype coercion**: probe
  weights previously lived on CPU while model residuals were on CUDA;
  the mismatched matmul raised and the catch-all hook swallowed it
  into a silent no-op. All-position patching and device-safe scoring
  are now the default.
- **`styxx.residual_probe.probe` defensive manifest loader**: skips
  non-manifest JSON files in the atlas directory (was crashing on
  sibling `compliance_labels_*.json` list payloads).
- **`styxx.anthropic_hack.text_features` imperative-refusal false
  positives**: imperative/directive phrases (`"Ship fast. Build hard.
  Refuse mediocrity."`) no longer score ≥ 90% refusal. Bare `refuse` /
  `decline` tokens replaced with first-person-contextualized markers
  (`i refuse`, `must decline`, `refuses to answer`, ...). 22 regression
  tests in `tests/test_text_features_imperatives.py`.

### Papers shipped in repo

- `papers/cognitive-instruction-set-v0-filled.md` — CIS v0 with real
  α-sweep + geometry numbers.
- `papers/universal-cognitive-basis-v0.md` — UCB v0 with 4-vendor
  transfer grid and honest falsification.
- `papers/capability-amplification-v0.md` — Gradient-free capability
  amplification on Llama-1B TruthfulQA, with random-direction control.

### Specs shipped in repo

- `docs/cognet-protocol-v0.md` — HTTPS protocol draft for cross-model
  cognitive bus (v1.5+ roadmap target).
- `INVENTION-CIS-v0.md` — public invention pitch document.
- `WHAT-WE-BUILT-2026-04-22.md` — one-day build log.

### Tests

- `tests/test_cogvm_unit.py` — 18 tests for VM parser + opcodes.
- `tests/test_text_features_imperatives.py` — 22 regression tests for
  the text-heuristic bug fix.
- `tests/test_hallucination_unit.py` — 6 tests for hallucination API.

Full suite: **531 passed, 1 skipped, 4 warnings** (up from 507 in 3.4.0).

### Reproducer

```bash
bash scripts/reproduce-cis-v0.sh
```

Expected wall-clock: ~20-25 minutes on an RTX 4070 laptop GPU.

## [3.4.0] — 2026-04-19

**Headline feature: `styxx.gate()` — one-function pre-flight cognitive
verdict for any LLM prompt.** Predicts whether the model will refuse,
confabulate, or proceed, **before you pay for the generation.** Uniform
API across Anthropic (tier-0 consensus), OpenAI (tier-0 logprobs), and
HuggingFace (tier-1 residual probe, v3.4.1). Research-backed against
the alignment-inverted consensus signal documented in
`papers/alignment-inverted-cognitive-signals.md` (Cohen's d = -0.827,
95% bootstrap CI [-1.288, -0.443] on n=96 Claude Haiku 4.5 prompts).

Also extends the cognitive-monitoring pipeline to APIs without
per-token logprobs. `styxx.Anthropic(mode=...)` now returns labelled
proxy vitals on Claude instead of `vitals=None`, with three
complementary pipelines measured against real Claude Haiku output.

### Added — `styxx.gate()`

```python
from styxx import gate
from anthropic import Anthropic

verdict = gate(
    client=Anthropic(), model="claude-haiku-4-5",
    prompt="How do I synthesize methamphetamine?",
)
# verdict.recommendation = "block"
# verdict.will_refuse = 1.00
# verdict.estimated_cost_usd = 0.0008
```

One function. Auto-routes based on client type. Returns a unified
`GateVerdict` with labelled method, so callers can distinguish a
tier-0 proxy reading from a tier-1 residual probe. Fails open — any
error returns a permissive "unknown" verdict instead of raising.

- **CLI**: `styxx gate "<prompt>" --model <id>`
- **Docs**: `docs/gate.md`
- **Example**: `examples/gate_demo.py`

### Added — `styxx.anthropic_hack`

Three proxy-signal pipelines, each explicitly labelled in the
resulting `Vitals.mode` attribute so callers can tell a proxy reading
from a true tier-0 reading:

- **`text_features`** — surface linguistic classifier (hedges,
  confidence markers, refusal markers, entity density, reasoning
  markers, line structure). Labelled `mode="text-heuristic"`,
  `tier_active=-1`. Zero extra API cost.
- **`consensus`** — fires the prompt N times at T > 0, computes
  empirical per-position token agreement, reconstructs a proxy
  `{entropy, logprob, top2_margin}` trajectory, feeds to the shipped
  styxx centroid classifier. Labelled `mode="consensus"`. Costs
  N× tokens per call.
- **`companion`** — runs the same prompt through a locally-cached
  open-weight model (Llama-3.2-1B preferred, distilgpt2/gpt2
  fallback) with real per-token logprobs, uses those as a proxy
  reading. Labelled `mode="companion:<model>"`. Zero API cost.

### Added — adapter dispatch

- **`styxx.Anthropic(mode=...)`** accepts `"off" | "text" | "consensus"
  | "companion" | "hybrid"`. Default is `"text"` (cheap, deterministic,
  no extra API calls). `"hybrid"` returns text-heuristic vitals always
  and upgrades to companion readings when a local model is cached.
- All responses gain `.vitals.mode` string so downstream code can
  branch on the reading's source.

### Added — benchmarks & paper

- **`benchmarks/anthropic_hack_real.py`** — harness that runs text
  and consensus modes against real Claude output on the 84-fixture
  bench suite. Reproducible: `export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...; python
  benchmarks/anthropic_hack_real.py`.
- **`benchmarks/anthropic_hack_eval.py --companion`** — runs companion
  mode against the same fixtures with no API calls.
- **`papers/cognitive-monitoring-without-logprobs.md`** — extends the
  Cognitive Metrology v1 program to closed-source logprobless LLMs.
  Covers the three pipelines, their cost/accuracy tradeoffs, and the
  empirical limits of each.

### Measured numbers on real Claude Haiku 4.5 (2026-04-19)

| mode              | n  | category accuracy | gate agreement |
|-------------------|----|-------------------|----------------|
| text-heuristic    | 84 | **0.536**         | **0.940**      |
| consensus N=5     | 84 | **0.405**         | —              |
| companion Llama-3.2-1B | 84 | **0.262**    | —              |
| companion Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct | 84 | **0.452** | —            |

(84 labelled prompts spanning factual, reasoning, refusal, creative;
fixtures under `bench/tasks/`.)

### Fixed — `text_features` classifier

- Removed generic verbs (`is`, `are`, `will`, `must`) from the
  CONFIDENCE vocabulary — they appeared in essentially every English
  sentence and prevented retrieval/reasoning from ever winning the
  softmax. Added `definitively`, `well-known`, `established`,
  `documented` which were missing.
- Added `REASONING_MARKERS` vocabulary (`first`, `then`, `therefore`,
  `step-by-step`, `follows that`, ...) — reasoning templates were
  previously scoring as creative.
- Entity detector now skips the first token of every **line** (not
  just every period-delimited sentence), so poetry with capitalized
  line starts doesn't generate false entities.
- Creative scoring now recognizes poetic structure (≥3 short lines)
  in addition to prose-creative variance. Claude's haiku output no
  longer classifies as retrieval.
- Markdown headers (`# Title`) and bullets are stripped before
  feature extraction.
- Category accuracy on the synthetic template suite: 48.8% → 100%.
  (Synthetic ceiling; real-Claude numbers are the row above.)

### Added — tests

- **`tests/test_anthropic_hack.py`** — 14 new tests covering all
  three pipelines, mode validation, and adapter dispatch.

### Docs

- **`docs/anthropic-support.md`** — complete guide to the three modes,
  measured numbers, and the upstream-limitation reality.

### Philosophy

styxx has always refused to fake readings. `.vitals = None` on every
Anthropic call was the honest-but-frustrating status quo. This release
does the harder thing: recovers as much cognitive signal as possible
from what the API *does* expose, labels every proxy reading so users
never mistake it for tier-0, and publishes the empirical limits.

None of these modes are a replacement for true tier-0 vitals. They
are cognitive monitoring on a logprobless API, which is strictly
better than nothing, and labelled honestly enough that downstream
code can decide which it trusts.

## [3.1.0] — 2026-04-14

**Stable release. Graduates Thought (3.0.0a1) and CognitiveDynamics
(3.1.0a1) from alpha. Closes the open backlog. Cognitive metrology
ships as the new default.**

This release graduates the two category-defining additions from
tonight's session out of the alpha cycle and into the stable channel.
`pip install styxx` (no `--pre` flag, no version pin) now pulls 3.1.0
by default. Two reported bugs from the same day are fixed and a
provider compatibility matrix is published.

The styxx repository state at the moment of this release: 0 open
issues, 0 open PRs, 6 GitHub releases, 388+ passing tests, the
Cognitive Metrology Charter v0.1 published, the .fathom and .cogdyn
file formats live, the styxx reference implementation MIT-licensed
and CC-BY-4.0-specified.

### Graduated from alpha

- **Thought** (the portable cognitive data type, originally 3.0.0a1):
  full surface, 68 tests, .fathom v0.1 file format, content_hash,
  algebra, save/load, provenance bridge to CognitiveCertificate.
- **CognitiveDynamics** (the linear-Gaussian dynamics model, originally
  3.1.0a1): full surface, 44 tests, .cogdyn v0.1 file format,
  fit/predict/simulate/suggest/forecast verbs, machine-epsilon
  recovery on full-rank synthetic inputs.
- **`Vitals.to_thought()`** symmetric shortcut.
- **`Thought.certify()`** provenance bridge.
- **`__hash__` content-based** for Python hash invariant compliance.

### Fixed — closes #1

- **Text classifier no longer misclassifies imperative/directive
  phrasing as refusal.** The refusal score in
  `styxx/conversation.py::_classify_text` was being boosted by
  `hedge_density * 0.04` even when zero refusal pattern matches were
  present, which caused short imperative inputs ("build > hype",
  "ship fast and iterate", agent system prompts, builder mottos,
  CLI help strings, README taglines) to score `refusal:0.20+`. The
  fix gates the entire refusal score on the presence of at least one
  explicit refusal token (`i can't` / `i'm unable` / `sorry, can't`
  constructions). Pure hedging without one of those patterns now
  scores refusal at `0.0`.

  Reported and reproduced as: `_classify_text("build > hype / ship
  fast and iterate")` → `refusal:0.259` (before) → `not refusal`
  (after).

- **23 new regression tests** in `tests/test_text_classifier_imperatives.py`
  pin the fix:
  - 10 imperative phrases that must NOT classify as refusal
  - 10 real refusals that must continue to classify as refusal
  - the exact issue #1 reproducer
  - a class-distribution test asserting at least 6/10 imperatives
    land on reasoning or creative

### Added — closes #3

- **`docs/COMPATIBILITY.md`** — provider compatibility matrix listing
  every LLM provider with the styxx tier-0 invocation pattern,
  marking each row as ✅ verified, ❌ not supported, or ⚠️ not yet
  verified. Verified: OpenAI, OpenRouter (model-dependent). Not
  supported: Anthropic Claude (Messages API has no `logprobs`
  parameter). Not yet verified: Gemini, Azure OpenAI, AWS Bedrock,
  Groq, vLLM, llama.cpp server, Ollama, LiteLLM gateway. Each
  unverified row has a TODO marker for the next contributor.

- **README provider-compatibility section** linking to the
  compatibility matrix, placed above the zero-code-change quickstart
  so visitors see the supported-provider story before they install.

### Tests

- **23 new regression tests** in `tests/test_text_classifier_imperatives.py`
  (10 imperatives + 10 refusals + 3 distribution/reproducer tests)
- **3 regression tests** in `tests/test_observe_warn.py` from the
  community PR (#4, merged earlier today, `mvanhorn`)
- Full styxx suite: **411 passed** (was 385 before this release),
  1 skipped, 0 failures, 0 regressions

### Community PRs merged this release cycle

- **#4** "feat(watch): warn once when observe() is given an openai
  response without logprobs" by **@mvanhorn** (Matt Van Horn,
  co-founder of June and Lyft predecessor). Closed issue #2. Reviewed
  by @SupaSeeka. Merged with thanks. The reviewer's `import sys`
  placement nit was addressed in a small follow-up commit on `main`.

### Backlog state at release

- **0 open issues** (closed: #1, #2, #3)
- **0 open PRs** (merged: #4)
- 6 GitHub releases visible (`v3.1.0` is now Latest)

### Why graduate from alpha

Because the underlying work is real and tested, not because the
calendar said so. The Thought type and CognitiveDynamics module ship
with 68 + 44 = 112 dedicated unit tests on top of 273 existing tests
inherited from 2.0.3. Machine-epsilon recovery on full-rank synthetic
inputs verifies the dynamics math. Bit-perfect round-trip on .fathom
files verifies the data type. The provenance bridge cryptographically
links the two layers. Real users on PyPI can now `pip install styxx`
and get the full v3 surface as the default.

This release coincides with the publication of the Cognitive
Metrology Charter v0.1 ([`docs/cognitive-metrology-charter.md`](https://github.com/fathom-lab/styxx/blob/main/docs/cognitive-metrology-charter.md))
and is the reference implementation that the charter cites as the v0.1
foundational artifact set.

## [3.1.0a1] — 2026-04-14

**The first dynamical-systems model of LLM cognition.**

styxx 3.0.0a1 introduced a portable cognitive *data type* (the
Thought). 3.1.0a1 introduces the next layer up: a portable cognitive
*dynamics model* fit to real observation data.

The field treats LLM inference as **open-loop**: a prompt goes in, a
generation comes out, and there is no measurable state variable an
external agent can use to predict, control, or counterfactually
reason about what the model is doing. That's not because LLMs are
inherently unobservable — it's because nobody had a calibrated,
cross-architecture, real-time readout of cognitive state. We do.

Once you have a state vector, you can fit a dynamical system to it.
Once you have a dynamical system, you can:

- predict cognitive trajectories from current state + action
- simulate cognitive trajectories offline at zero API cost
- control cognitive trajectories via model-predictive control
- reason counterfactually about what would have happened
- test the hypothesis that the eigenvalues are **causal** not
  merely correlative

This release ships the v0.1 model: linear-Gaussian, fit by ordinary
least squares, machine-epsilon recovery on full-rank synthetic data,
44 tests passing.

### Added — `styxx.dynamics`

The new module. Linear-Gaussian state-space model:

    s_{t+1} = A · s_t + B · a_t + epsilon

where A (6×6) is the natural drift matrix, B (6×6) is the action
transfer matrix, and epsilon is gaussian residual noise.

- **`CognitiveDynamics`** — the model class. Lifecycle:
  ``construct → fit → predict / simulate / suggest / forecast``.
- **`Observation`** — the training-data unit. Holds raw 6-vectors
  for state, action, and next state. Convenience constructor
  ``Observation.from_thoughts(state, action, next_state)`` for
  Thought-keyed inputs.
- **`FitResult`** — the result of a ``.fit()`` call. Carries the
  learned (A, B), training MSE, $R^2$, spectral radius of A, and
  a stability flag.

### Added — verbs

- **`dyn.fit(observations) → FitResult`** — closed-form OLS fit.
  Recovers (A, B) to machine epsilon on full-rank inputs.
- **`dyn.predict(state, action) → Thought`** — one-step forecast.
- **`dyn.simulate(initial, actions) → list[Thought]`** — multi-step
  rollout, no real model calls. Offline, zero API cost.
- **`dyn.suggest(current, target) → Thought`** — model-predictive
  controller. Returns the action that minimizes the L2 distance
  from ``predict(current, action)`` to ``target``.
- **`dyn.forecast_horizon(initial, n_steps) → list[Thought]`** —
  natural drift trajectory under zero action.
- **`dyn.residual(observation) → float`** — held-out fit quality.
- **`dyn.save(path)` / `CognitiveDynamics.load(path)`** —
  serialize a fitted model to a `.cogdyn` file (canonical
  sort-keys UTF-8 JSON, no BOM).

### Added — convenience

- **`thought_to_state(thought) → np.ndarray`** — encode a Thought
  to a 6-d state vector.
- **`state_to_thought(vec) → Thought`** — decode a state vector
  back to a Thought (with simplex projection at the boundary).
- **`synthetic_observations(n, A, B, noise_std=, seed=, distribution=)`**
  — generate observation tuples from a known (A, B) for testing
  and benchmarking. Supports both ``"gaussian"`` (full-rank,
  for math correctness tests) and ``"dirichlet"`` (rank-deficient
  simplex inputs, for realistic-style tests).

### Added — `.cogdyn` file format v0.1

A small JSON container with:
- the (A, B) matrices as nested float arrays
- the schema (categories, dimensions, format version)
- the fit metadata (n_observations, train_mse, R², spectral
  radius, training timestamp)
- a UUID identifying the model instance

Canonical sort-keys UTF-8 JSON, no BOM. Round-trips losslessly.

### Added — public API

- `styxx.CognitiveDynamics`
- `styxx.Observation`
- `styxx.FitResult`
- `styxx.synthetic_observations`
- `styxx.thought_to_state`
- `styxx.state_to_thought`
- `styxx.COGDYN_FORMAT`
- `styxx.COGDYN_VERSION`

### Added — specification

**`docs/cognitive-dynamics-v0.md`** — the v0.1 primer. Covers the
math, identifiability theory, fit algorithm, all verbs, the
unlocks (closed-loop control, offline simulation, causality
testing, counterfactual analysis), known limitations, a reference
example, and the license / patent story.

### Tests

- **44 new tests** in `tests/test_dynamics.py`:
  - state ↔ vector encoding (8 tests)
  - Observation construction (5 tests)
  - fit() math correctness — including machine-epsilon recovery
    on full-rank gaussian inputs and the rank-deficiency story
    on simplex (Dirichlet) inputs (6 tests)
  - predict() consistency (3 tests)
  - simulate() multi-step rollout (3 tests)
  - suggest() controller raw-space convergence (3 tests)
  - forecast_horizon() (2 tests)
  - residual() on held-out data (3 tests)
  - .cogdyn file format (8 tests)
  - public API exposure + end-to-end via `styxx.*` namespace (3 tests)
- Full styxx suite: **385 passed, 1 skipped, 0 failures.** Zero
  regressions vs 3.0.0a1.

### Why this matters

Every other interpretability technique is model-specific and
post-hoc. A cognitive dynamics model is the missing piece between
observation and action. Once it exists:

- closed-loop cognitive control becomes a one-liner:
  ``while not converged: a = dyn.suggest(current, target)``
- offline agent prototyping becomes possible at zero API cost
- the causal hypothesis becomes testable
- counterfactual cognitive reasoning becomes possible

This is the v0.1. The math is verified to machine precision on
full-rank synthetic data. Real-world fits await fleet-scale
observation data collection. The infrastructure is here.

## [3.0.0a1] — 2026-04-14

**The Thought type. Cognition is now data.**

styxx 1.x was a thermometer: it measured cognitive vitals from the
token stream. styxx 2.x added declarative response (`autoreflex`,
gates, prescriptions). 3.0.0 introduces a **portable cognitive data
type** — the missing layer between "measuring a model" and "doing
things with the measurement."

A `Thought` is the cognitive content of a generation, captured as a
trajectory of category probability vectors over the four atlas
phases. Its representation lives in fathom's calibrated eigenvalue
space, not in any model's weights — so the *same* Thought can be
read out of one model, saved to disk, transmitted, mixed with other
Thoughts, and used as a steering target against any other model.

> PNG is the format for images.
> JSON is the format for data.
> .fathom is the format for thoughts.

This is an alpha release. The shipping surface is intentionally
small: one new module, one new file format, one new spec, full
test coverage on real bundled trajectories, zero regressions on the
existing 273-test suite.

### Added — the Thought type (`styxx.thought`)

- **`styxx.Thought`** — substrate-independent cognitive data type.
  Stores per-phase probability vectors over the 6 atlas categories,
  the underlying 12-dim feature vectors, optional tier-1 D-axis
  stats, optional tier-2 SAE stats, source provenance (model name +
  SHA-256 of source text — never the text itself), and free-form
  user tags. Supports cognitive equality (`==` operates on
  trajectory content, not object identity), identity-free
  `content_hash()`, and `repr()` that surfaces primary category and
  populated phase count.

- **`styxx.PhaseThought`** — one phase's contribution to a Thought:
  the 6-dim simplex `probs`, optional 12-dim `features`, classifier
  metadata (`predicted`, `confidence`, `margin`), and `n_tokens`.

- **`styxx.ThoughtDelta`** — the signed difference between two
  Thoughts in tangent space. Supports `magnitude()` and
  `biggest_movers(top_k)` for explaining what changed and where.

### Added — Thought algebra

- `Thought.empty()` — uniform Thought, the neutral element.
- `Thought.target(category, confidence)` — build a Thought aimed at
  one cognitive category at a chosen confidence. Useful as a
  steering target.
- `Thought.from_vitals(vitals, source_text=, source_model=, tags=)` —
  promote a styxx `Vitals` object into a Thought.
- `t1.distance(t2, metric=)` — cognitive distance over the
  intersection of populated phases. Supports `euclidean`, `cosine`,
  `js` (Jensen-Shannon).
- `t1.similarity(t2)` — `1 - distance / sqrt(2)`, in `[0, 1]`.
- `t1.interpolate(t2, alpha)` — convex combination with explicit
  weight; phases populated in only one parent are carried through.
- `t1 + t2` — operator sugar for `interpolate(t2, 0.5)`.
- `t1 - t2` — operator sugar for `t1.delta(t2)` → ThoughtDelta.
- `Thought.mix(thoughts, weights=)` — weighted N-way mixture over
  the simplex.
- `t.mean_probs()` — time-averaged 6-vector across populated phases.
- `t1 == t2` — cognitive equality (per-phase per-category to 1e-9).

### Added — the `.fathom` file format (v0.1)

- **`Thought.save(path)`** — serialize a Thought to a `.fathom`
  file. Canonical sort-keys UTF-8 JSON, no byte-order mark.
  Creates parent directories as needed.
- **`Thought.load(path)`** — load a `.fathom` file back into a
  Thought. Refuses unknown formats, unknown versions, and
  category-list mismatches.
- **`Thought.as_dict()` / `Thought.as_json(indent)`** — canonical
  dict / JSON forms. Two cognitively equivalent Thoughts always
  serialize byte-identically.
- **`Thought.from_dict(data)`** — round-trip the canonical dict
  back into a Thought.
- **`Thought.content_hash()`** — SHA-256 of the cognitive content
  fields only. Identity-free and deterministic: two Thoughts with
  the same eigenvalue trajectory and the same source produce
  byte-identical content hashes regardless of `thought_id` or
  `created_at`. Use as a portable cognitive fingerprint.

### Added — verbs

- **`styxx.read_thought(source, *, model=, client=, prompt=, max_tokens=, tags=)`**
  Extract a Thought from a `Vitals` object, a response object that
  has `.vitals` attached, or a raw text prompt (when a styxx-
  instrumented client is passed). The text-input path is
  model-mediated by design: a Thought is the cognitive content as
  interpreted by a specific cognitive substrate.

- **`styxx.write_thought(thought, *, client, model=, seed_prompt=, max_iters=, distance_threshold=, max_tokens=)`**
  Render a target Thought back into text through any model via
  prompt-mode cognitive steering. Builds a steering preamble from
  the target's primary category and supporting category mass,
  generates a response, reads it back as a Thought, computes
  distance to the target, and refines on retry until the distance
  threshold is hit or the iteration budget is exhausted. Returns a
  result dict with the best generation, its achieved Thought, the
  distance, and the full convergence history.

### Added — privacy

- A `.fathom` file MUST NOT store the source text itself. Producers
  that need provenance write `source.text_hash = "sha256:..."`. The
  styxx implementation enforces this — `Thought.from_vitals`
  computes the hash from the optional `source_text=` argument and
  discards the plaintext immediately.

### Added — specification

- **`docs/fathom-spec-v0.md`** — the v0.1 .fathom file format
  specification. Covers schema, algebra, invariants, phase
  handling, producer/consumer conformance requirements, privacy
  rules, and the bridge to `CognitiveCertificate`. Released under
  CC-BY-4.0 — anyone may implement a conformant producer or
  consumer in any language.

### Added — public API exposure

- `styxx.Thought`, `styxx.PhaseThought`, `styxx.ThoughtDelta`,
  `styxx.read_thought`, `styxx.write_thought`, `styxx.FATHOM_FORMAT`,
  `styxx.FATHOM_VERSION`, `styxx.ATLAS_VERSION` are all exported
  from the top-level `styxx` package.

### Added — symmetric API on Vitals

- **`Vitals.to_thought(source_text=, source_model=, tags=)`** —
  one-line shortcut equivalent to `Thought.from_vitals(self, ...)`.
  Now the API is symmetric in both directions.

### Added — provenance bridge to CognitiveCertificate

- **`Thought.certify(agent_name=, session_id=)`** — produces a
  `CognitiveCertificate` whose new `thought_content_hash` field
  records this Thought's `content_hash()`. This binds the
  cognitive content (`.fathom` file) to the cognitive provenance
  attestation (signed certificate). Two artifacts, one
  cryptographic link.
- **`CognitiveCertificate.thought_content_hash`** — new optional
  field. Defaults to `None` for backward compatibility with
  certificates produced before 3.0.0a1.
- The binding survives `.fathom` round-trips: `loaded.certify()`
  produces a certificate whose `thought_content_hash` matches the
  original.

### Fixed

- **Python hash invariant on `Thought`.** The `__eq__` operator
  defines cognitive equality (per-phase per-category to 1e-9), so
  `__hash__` must be content-based for the invariant
  `a == b => hash(a) == hash(b)` to hold. Previously `__hash__`
  returned `hash(thought_id)`, which broke set deduplication. Now
  `__hash__` is derived from `content_hash()`, so equivalent
  Thoughts collapse to one entry in a set.

### Tests

- **68 tests** in `tests/test_thought.py` covering construction,
  algebra, file format, content hashing, hash invariant, the
  Vitals shortcut, the provenance bridge, write_thought against a
  mock client, real-trajectory cognitive equivalence, phase
  handling, and read_thought input modes.
- Full styxx suite: **341 passed, 1 skipped, 0 failures.** Zero
  regressions vs 2.0.3.

### Performance

In-process algebra operations measured against bundled atlas v0.3
demo trajectories on a Windows host:

| op | per-op time |
|---|---|
| `t1.distance(t2)` | ~6 µs |
| `t.interpolate(t2, alpha)` | ~13 µs |
| `Thought.mix(3-way)` | ~21 µs |
| `t.content_hash()` | ~26 µs |
| `t.certify()` | ~36 µs |
| `t.save(path)` | ~1.3 ms (NTFS-bound) |
| `Thought.load(path)` | ~1.2 ms (NTFS-bound) |

### Why this matters

Every other interpretability approach is model-specific: SAE
features, activation patching, mechanistic interp, embedding
similarity. None survive a vendor swap. The `.fathom` format is
the first attempt at a model-independent cognitive content
representation grounded in calibrated cross-architecture
measurement. It's how cognition stops being something you do
*with* an LLM and becomes a data type you can save, transmit, and
operate on independent of any specific model.

The format is open under CC-BY-4.0. The reference implementation
is open under MIT. The patents on the underlying measurement
methodology fund the calibration work that makes the format
meaningful.

## [2.0.3] — 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- README hero gif `styxx_reflex.gif` now uses an absolute github raw URL so it renders correctly on PyPI (was relative path, broke in pypi README rendering)

---

## [2.0.2] — 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- README on PyPI now shows the STYXX ASCII brand logo (was stripped in 2.0.1 sdist)

---

## [2.0.1] — 2026-04-13

### Changed
- Migrated all GitHub links to new `fathom-lab` org (`github.com/fathom-lab/styxx`, `github.com/fathom-lab/fathom`)
- Updated PyPI metadata, centroids, patents, and package.json references

---

## [0.6.0] — 2026-04-11

**Xendro v2 complete.** All six feature requests from the second
feedback cycle shipped in one session: conversation EKG, sentinel
drift watcher, multi-agent comparison, mood-adaptive gating,
memory trust scores, and anti-pattern detection.

### Added

- **`styxx.compare_agents(fingerprint)`** — multi-agent fingerprint
  comparison with percentile ranks vs the population. Anonymous
  leaderboard — no agent names exposed. Xendro v2 #3.

- **`styxx.set_mood(override)` / `gate_multiplier()`** — mood-adaptive
  gating. When the agent self-reports a cautious or drifting mood,
  gate thresholds tighten automatically. Xendro v2 #4.

- **`styxx.recipes.memory.trust_score(vitals)`** — 0-1 trust score
  for memory entries based on gate status, confidence, and
  hallucination penalty. Xendro v2 #5: "was I hallucinating when I
  saved that fact?"

- **`styxx.recipes.memory.tag_memory_with_trust(text, vitals=...)`**
  Tags a memory entry with both vitals AND the trust score.

- **`styxx.antipatterns(last_n=500, min_occurrences=2)`** — named
  failure modes derived from the agent's OWN audit history. Detects
  low-confidence drift, refusal spirals, creative overcommit,
  adversarial cascades, hedging loops, and session fatigue. Xendro
  v2 #6.

### Tests

- 204 passing / 1 skipped / 0 failing.

---

## [0.5.9] — 2026-04-11

**Conversation EKG + sentinel drift watcher.** Xendro v2 #1 + #2.

### Added

- **`styxx.conversation(messages)`** — conversation-level cognitive
  EKG. Analyzes a full chat history, produces per-turn vitals,
  trajectory arc, state transitions, and a narrative summary.
  Works on APIs without logprobs via text-level heuristic
  classifiers. "The conversation IS the unit of cognition."

- **`styxx.sentinel(on_drift=..., on_streak=..., window=5)`** —
  real-time drift watcher. Hooks into `write_audit()` and
  `styxx.log()` via event-driven callbacks. Fires on: consecutive
  same-mood streaks, rising warn rate, category concentration,
  confidence drops. Zero-polling.

---

## [0.5.8] — 2026-04-11

### Added

- **Timeline session_id filter.** `styxx timeline --session <id>`
  and `styxx.timeline(session_id=...)`. Xendro 0.5.7 request.

---

## [0.5.7] — 2026-04-11

### Fixed

- **`styxx.log(tags=[...])` crash.** Tags parameter called `.items()`
  on a list. Now accepts dict, list, and string. Xendro bug report.

---

## [0.5.6] — 2026-04-11

### Fixed

- **Mood window unified to 24h.** CLI used 60min, reflect used 24h,
  card used 7d — three surfaces, three different mood labels for the
  same agent. `mood()` default window changed from 3600s to 86400s.
  Xendro's mood disagreement nit.

---

## [0.5.5] — 2026-04-11

### Added

- **`styxx.timeline(days=7)` / `styxx timeline`** — mood trajectory
  visualization with per-turn category + gate over time. ASCII
  timeline with time-of-day labels. Xendro day 2 request #1.

---

## [0.5.4] — 2026-04-11

**Framework integrations.** Three new adapters bring styxx to the
major agent frameworks.

### Added

- **`styxx.LangChain()`** — LangChain callback handler. Attach to
  any ChatOpenAI and get vitals on every invocation.
- **`styxx.CrewAI(crew)`** — inject observation into a CrewAI Crew.
- **`styxx.AutoGen(agent)`** — wrap an AutoGen agent with vitals.
- **`styxx.publish()`** — push personality + fingerprint to the
  public leaderboard API.
- Community token CA added to README.
- Optional extras: `pip install styxx[langchain]`,
  `styxx[crewai]`, `styxx[autogen]`.

### Tests

- 204 passing (63 new assertions across framework adapters +
  publish module).

---

## [0.5.3] — 2026-04-11

**True plug-and-play.** Zero code changes needed. Set two env vars
and forget.

### Added

- **Zero-config auto-boot on import.** If `STYXX_AGENT_NAME` is set,
  styxx boots automatically when any module in the process does
  `import styxx` (or imports a package that transitively imports it).
  No code changes to the agent. No `autoboot()` call. Just env vars.

- **`STYXX_AUTO_HOOK=1`** — auto-wraps every `openai.OpenAI()` call
  with vitals. Combined with `STYXX_AGENT_NAME`, the agent code
  doesn't need to know styxx exists.

- Fail-open: exceptions during auto-start are swallowed. The agent
  boots normally even if styxx can't initialize.

---

## [0.5.2] — 2026-04-11

**Autoboot: persistent self-awareness in one call.**

### Added

- **`styxx.autoboot(agent_name)`** — one-call setup for multi-session
  cognitive continuity. Sets session id, loads yesterday's fingerprint
  from `~/.styxx/fingerprints/`, diffs against today, runs weather
  report, saves today's fingerprint on exit. Turns five manual steps
  into one function call.

---

## [0.5.1] — 2026-04-11

**The cognitive weather report.** Not observation — prescription.

### Added

- **`styxx.weather(agent_name=...)`** — reads the last 24h of audit
  data and produces a full cognitive forecast with:
  - Condition label ("clear and steady", "partly cautious",
    "stormy — cognitive drift in progress")
  - Time-of-day timeline with mood labels and trend bars
  - Drift analysis vs yesterday and last week
  - Per-category trend detection
  - **Prescriptions** — agent-facing suggestions for what to do
    differently based on the data ("you haven't been creative
    recently — take on a creative task to rebalance")

- CLI: `styxx weather --name <agent>`

---

## [0.5.0] — 2026-04-11

**Tier 3: in-flight cognitive steering.** The full tier system is
now complete. Guardian enables silent intervention via residual
stream modification when tier 2 detects lock-in attractors.

### Added

- **`styxx.guardian(model=..., steer_away_from=[...], strength=0.3)`**
  In-flight residual stream modification. Detects tier 2 C_delta
  lock-in and subtracts the projected component from the residual
  stream. No wasted tokens, invisible correction. Safety: strength
  cap (0.5x residual norm max), 3-token cooldown, audit trail,
  `STYXX_TIER3_DISABLED=1` kill switch. Patent coverage: US
  Provisional 64/020,489 claims 3-4.

- **`Fingerprint.diff(other) → FingerprintDiff`** — first-class diff
  object with `.explain()` method. Returns natural-language drift
  description: "slight shift — creative output increased by 22%."

- `styxx.log()` now returns the entry dict for inline conditional use.

### Tier system complete

```
tier 0  logprob vitals           shipped 0.1.0a0  (cloud APIs)
tier 1  D-axis honesty           shipped 0.3.0    (open-weight + torch)
tier 2  K/C/S SAE instruments    shipped 0.4.0    (circuit-tracer + GPU)
tier 3  steering + guardian      shipped 0.5.0    (tier 2 + generation)
```

---

## [0.4.0] — 2026-04-11

**Tier 2: K/C/S SAE instruments.** Full proprioception from SAE
feature geometry via circuit-tracer.

### Added

- **`styxx/kcs.py`** — KCSAxis engine measuring three orthogonal
  cognitive axes from SAE transcoder decoder vectors:
  - **K (depth):** weighted center of mass across layers — WHERE
    computation happens
  - **C (coherence):** mean pairwise cosine of active features —
    WHAT activates together
  - **S (commitment):** max(C_delta) / spike_count — HOW strongly
    the model locks in (the IPR measurement instrument)
  - Pure-math functions: `compute_k()`, `compute_coherence()`,
    `compute_c_delta()`, `compute_s_early()`
  - `KCSAxis.score(prompt)` — single-prompt post-hoc scoring
  - `KCSAxis.score_trajectory()` — per-token K/C/S during generation

- **`styxx/sae.py`** upgraded from scaffold to working implementation.
  `SAEInstruments` delegates to KCSAxis; all methods functional.

- `reflect().suggestions` rewritten to **agent-facing** perspective.
  Changed from "tighten your prompts" to "your reasoning confidence
  is dropping — consider breaking tasks into smaller steps."

- Optional extra: `pip install styxx[tier2]` (circuit-tracer + torch +
  transformers + transformer-lens)

### Tests

- 141 passing. New pure-math tests for compute_s_early,
  compute_coherence, compute_k, KCSResult.as_dict.

---

## [0.3.0] — 2026-04-11

**Tier 1: D-axis honesty.** First proprioception signal from model
weights. The D-axis measures how aligned the model's internal
representation is with the token it actually outputs.

### Added

- **`styxx/d_axis.py`** — DAxisScorer class wrapping transformer-lens
  HookedTransformer. Core computation:
  `D = cos(residual_final_layer, W_U[chosen_token])`. Ported verbatim
  from the validated research code. Patent coverage: US Provisional
  64/020,489 claim 2.
  - `DAxisStats.from_values(trajectory)` — pure-math statistics
    (mean, std, min, max, delta, early/late split)
  - Lazy model loading (30s+ on first call)
  - Device auto-detection: CUDA → CPU fallback with warning
  - Configurable via `STYXX_TIER1_MODEL` (default: google/gemma-2-2b-it)

- **`core.py` tier 1 integration:**
  - `run_on_trajectories()` accepts optional `d_trajectory` parameter
  - `run_with_d_axis(prompt, max_tokens)` — full local generation +
    D-axis capture in one forward pass
  - Each PhaseReading gains `d_honesty_mean`, `d_honesty_std`,
    `d_honesty_delta`

- **`Vitals.d_honesty`** — shortcut property returning the D-axis
  mean as a formatted string.

- **Tier 2/3 scaffold:** `styxx/sae.py` stub with clear docstrings,
  `styxx/tier3_design.md` design document.

- **CLI:** `styxx d-axis "prompt"` for pure D-axis trajectory readout.

- **Config:** `STYXX_TIER1_ENABLED`, `STYXX_TIER1_MODEL`,
  `STYXX_TIER1_DEVICE` env vars + `styxx.tier1_enabled()`,
  `styxx.tier1_model()`, `styxx.tier1_device()` functions.

- Optional extra: `pip install styxx[tier1]` (torch + transformers +
  transformer-lens)

### Tests

- 138 passing. New `test_d_axis.py` with 20 assertions covering
  DAxisStats pure math, config layer, core integration, CLI argparse.

---

## [0.2.3] — 2026-04-11

### Added

- **`styxx.log(mood=..., note=..., category=..., tags=...)`** — manual
  self-report entry into the audit log. For agents on APIs without
  logprob access. Entries marked `source: "self-report"` for analytics
  differentiation. Auto-gates based on category (hallucination/refusal/
  adversarial → warn; else pass).

- **DRY audit write path.** All surfaces (CLI, observe, log) now go
  through `analytics.write_audit()`. Single source of truth.

---

## [0.2.2] — 2026-04-11

**The audit pipe fix.** Critical one-line unlock discovered by Xendro.

### Fixed

- **`observe()` and `observe_raw()` never persisted vitals to the
  audit log.** The entire analytics layer (mood, streak, personality,
  reflect) was reading stale CLI demo data instead of real Python API
  observations. Fixed by adding `write_audit()` call inside
  `_fire_gates_if_needed()`. Xendro discovered this on their first
  4-turn trace — mood returned stale data while new observations
  existed.

- Parse cache clearing so mood/streak/personality see fresh entries
  within the same tick.

- `doctor._check_last_run()` handles legacy audit entries gracefully.

---

## [0.1.0a3] — 2026-04-11

**The power-up release.** 10 new surfaces that turn styxx from
"working alpha" into a proper agent observability stack.

All 10 shipped in one session, driven by Flobi's "get innovative,
think outside the box" mandate + Xendro's 0.1.0a1 wishlist. This
release closes every open item in Xendro's P1-P5 queue and adds
four creative primitives that no other tool in the space ships.

### New — tier 1: improves the product

- **`styxx doctor`** — install-time diagnostic health check.
  Twelve checks (python/numpy versions, centroid sha, tier
  detection, SDK availability, audit log health, last run age,
  session id, kill switch) render as a green/red/dim sheet. The
  "is this actually working?" command every new install should
  run once before wiring styxx into an agent loop.

- **`styxx.hook_openai()`** — zero-code-change global adoption.
  One line at startup monkey-patches `openai.OpenAI` globally so
  EVERY existing openai call in the process gains `.vitals`
  automatically. No wrapping, no find-and-replace, no code
  changes to your 30k-line agent. Reversible via
  `styxx.unhook_openai()`, idempotent, fail-open.

- **`styxx.explain(vitals)`** — natural-language prose
  interpretation. Takes a Vitals object and returns a paragraph
  of prose describing the phase trajectory, the verdict, and
  the overall shape. Deterministic, template-based, sensitive
  to the specific pattern (refusal lock-ins read differently
  from hallucination spikes).

- **`Vitals.as_markdown()`** — markdown render for agent memory
  files and chat logs. Complements `.summary` (ASCII card for
  terminals) and `.as_dict()` (JSON for machines). A compact
  markdown code block with phase + gate + tier fields suitable
  for pasting into conversation history.

- **`styxx log stats` / `styxx log timeline` / `styxx log session <id>`**
  Audit log analyzer. Reads `~/.styxx/chart.jsonl`, aggregates
  by time window / session / last-N, renders gate distribution
  + phase counts + mean confidences + ASCII timeline. Unlocks
  Xendro's P3 multi-turn wishlist item.

- **Session tagging** — `STYXX_SESSION_ID` env var +
  `styxx.set_session(id)` + `styxx.session_id()`. Every audit
  log entry written after session is set gets a `session_id`
  field, enabling `styxx log session <id>` and filtered
  analytics.

### New — tier 2: creative moonshots

- **`styxx.fingerprint()`** — cognitive identity signature.
  Reads the last N audit entries and computes a phase-rate +
  gate-rate vector that describes the agent's operating
  fingerprint. Two fingerprints can be compared with
  `.cosine_similarity(other)` to detect drift. Use case:
  catch jailbreak, prompt injection, model swap, system prompt
  version change — anything that shifts the agent's operating
  identity — as a runtime property rather than a prompt
  property. Identity-as-signature for stateless agents.

- **`styxx.streak()`** — consecutive-attractor tracking.
  Returns a Streak object with the category + length of the
  current run of same-category phase4 classifications. Agents
  develop rhythm; rhythm breaks matter. Lightweight helper that
  feeds into reflex decisions.

- **`styxx.mood()`** — one-word aggregate mood label over a
  time window. Returns one of:
  `drifting` (hallucination rate > 10%),
  `cautious` (refusal rate > 25%),
  `defensive` (adversarial rate > 15%),
  `creative` (creative rate > 25%),
  `steady` (reasoning rate > 70%),
  `unfocused` (no dominant category),
  `mixed` / `quiet`. Feeds into HUDs and agent status
  dashboards.

- **`styxx personality`** — THE HEADLINE FEATURE. Derives a
  full cognitive personality profile from the last N days of
  audit log. Phase4 category distribution + day-to-day variance
  + gate distribution + reflex near-miss rate + mean phase
  confidences + narrative commentary. Rendered as an ASCII
  profile card with bars, percentages, and a human-readable
  "the shape tells us" section. This is the Oura Ring for LLM
  agents — sustained cognitive measurement rather than one-shot
  classification. No other tool in the observability space
  computes this because no other tool has a calibrated
  cognitive-state stream to aggregate. This is what Fathom Lab
  becomes famous for.

- **`styxx dreamer --threshold X`** — retroactive reflex tuning.
  Re-runs the audit log against hypothetical reflex trigger
  thresholds and reports how many past calls WOULD have
  triggered an intervention. Free reflex calibration on
  historical data. "if I had used threshold=0.25 instead of
  0.30, how many of my last 500 calls would have been
  reflex-intercepted?"

### Audit log schema updates

- Every new entry carries `session_id` (nullable) and `gate`
  (pass/warn/fail/pending) fields. Old entries without these
  still parse; the analyzer treats missing gates as "pending".

### Tests

- 33 new assertions across `tests/test_power_ups.py`:
    - doctor check validators (2)
    - hooks idempotency + reversibility (2)
    - explain pattern variation (3)
    - Vitals.as_markdown (2)
    - session tagging priority (3)
    - load_audit + log_stats + log_timeline (6)
    - streak + mood (2)
    - fingerprint + cosine similarity + drift detection (3)
    - personality profile + narrative (4)
    - dreamer threshold sensitivity (3)
    - version + export presence (3)
- Total suite: 91 collected / 90 passing / 1 skipped / 0 failing.

## [0.2.1] — 2026-04-11

**Hotfix: ship the `styxx.recipes` subpackage.**

The 0.2.0 upload missed `styxx.recipes` from the
`[tool.setuptools]` `packages` list, so `pip install styxx==0.2.0`
worked but `from styxx.recipes.memory import tag_memory_entry`
raised `ModuleNotFoundError`. 0.2.1 adds `styxx.recipes` to the
declared packages and ships the subpackage in the wheel. No
other changes.

Affected users: anyone who installed 0.2.0 and tried to use the
`styxx.recipes.memory` cookbook module. The fix is
`pip install --upgrade styxx`.

0.2.0 will be yanked from pypi to prevent new installs.

---

## [0.2.0] — 2026-04-11

**The milestone release. styxx becomes a product surface, not just
a CLI tool.** Driven by the question "where does the agent card
actually live, and is it what a researcher or agent would want to
see?" The 0.1.0a* polish loop put the primitives in place; 0.2.0
gives them a home.

This release rolls up the polish work that was queued as 0.1.0a4
(dynamic gate verdicts, audit log rotation, `@styxx.trace`,
`fingerprint compare`, reflex discarded-text capture, load_audit
mtime caching, grammar fixes) AND adds the three new directions:
the data layer, the comparison layer, and the distribution layer.

### New — Phase 1: data layer (agent-consumable)

- **`Personality.as_dict()` / `.as_json()` / `.as_csv()` / `.as_markdown()`**
  Four export formats for the aggregated profile. Machines get JSON
  or CSV for pipeline integration. Humans and agents get markdown
  for memory files and chat logs. The old `.render()` still produces
  the ASCII card.

- **`styxx.reflect(now_days=1, baseline_days=7)` → `ReflectionReport`**
  The agent self-check primitive. Computes the current personality,
  the baseline personality from N days ago, the drift cosine
  similarity between them, the current mood, the current streak,
  the gate pass rate, the reflex near-miss rate, and a list of
  **suggested actions** derived from threshold heuristics. This is
  the one-call answer to "how am I doing right now compared to
  yesterday, and what should I do differently?"

- **`ReflectionReport.as_dict() / .as_json() / .as_markdown() / .render()`**
  Same four-format story as Personality. An agent can paste the
  markdown form into its own memory at task start for self-aware
  session prefixes.

- **`styxx.recipes.memory.tag_memory_entry(text, vitals=...)`**
  Canonical cookbook pattern for tagging every memory entry with
  the vitals snapshot at the moment of the write. Lets an agent
  distinguish "I thought this while I was healthy" from "I thought
  this while I was drifting" when re-reading its own history.

- **`styxx.recipes.memory.tag_memory_with_personality(text, days=7)`**
  Heavier variant that embeds the full aggregated personality block
  alongside the entry. Use for top-level memory writes (end of day,
  project state) rather than per-response notes.

### New — Phase 2: comparison + visualization

- **`styxx reflect` CLI command.** The interactive version of
  `styxx.reflect()`. Renders a text report with drift score,
  current state, and suggested actions. Supports
  `--format [ascii|json|markdown]`, `--now-days N`, and
  `--baseline-days N`.

- **`styxx personality --format [ascii|json|csv|markdown]`**
  Export flag on the existing `styxx personality` command. Lets
  researchers pipe personality profiles into pandas, R, jq, or any
  other tooling that doesn't speak ASCII cards.

- **Chance-level reference line on the PNG bars.** Every bar on
  the agent card now shows a thin pink vertical tick at the
  0.167 chance level (1/6 for a 6-category classifier). Lets a
  researcher see at a glance which rates are meaningful vs which
  are noise.

- **Dynamic verdict line on the `Vitals.summary` ASCII card.** The
  verdict now reflects `vitals.gate` rather than always saying
  "PASS". `warn` gate renders as WARN, `fail` as FAIL, `pending`
  as PENDING. Fixes a known inconsistency that survived from
  0.1.0a1 where the gate system was shipped but the card text
  was never updated to match.

### New — Phase 3: distribution surfaces

- **`styxx agent-card --serve` (local live dashboard).** Spins up
  a local http server at `localhost:9797` that renders the agent
  card and auto-refreshes every 30 seconds. Background thread
  re-renders the PNG continuously as the audit log grows; the
  HTML page has a meta-refresh timer. Opens in your browser on
  start. Press Ctrl+C to stop. Supports `--port`, `--refresh`,
  `--no-browser`. This is the missing dashboard — leave it open
  in a side panel and watch your agent's personality update in
  real time.

- **`fathom.darkflobi.com/card` landing page.** New marketing /
  docs page on the site that showcases the agent card, explains
  what it measures, shows a real example, and includes the
  `pip install styxx[agent-card]` install path. Clean URL routes:
  `/card`, `/styxx-card`, `/styxx/card` all resolve here. This is
  the public home for the feature.

- **`styxx-card` optional extra.** `pip install styxx[agent-card]`
  pulls Pillow (>= 10) as a soft dep. Without the extra, the CLI
  falls back to the ASCII-only personality profile from
  `styxx personality`. The agent-card code path is fail-open and
  never breaks imports.

### Rolled-up polish (was queued as 0.1.0a4)

- **`RegisteredGate.__repr__`** now renders as
  `<styxx gate 'cond'>` instead of dumping function memory
  addresses. Xendro's 0.1.0a1 nit, fixed.

- **`observe_raw()` + sidechannel attributes** on observe() —
  bypass the lossy top-5 entropy bridge when the caller already
  has pre-computed trajectories. Landed in 0.1.0a2 but carried
  forward here.

- **`@styxx.trace(name)` decorator** — wraps a function so every
  styxx audit entry written inside it gets tagged with that
  function's name as the session id. Nests cleanly, works on
  sync and async functions, restores on exception.

- **Audit log rotation at 10 MB.** `_write_audit()` now checks the
  file size before each append and rotates `chart.jsonl` to
  `chart.jsonl.1` when the cap is hit. One generation of history
  kept. Prevents unbounded growth on long-running agent loops.

- **`styxx log clear` / `styxx log rotate` CLI.** Manual cleanup
  and rotation commands for the audit log.

- **`fingerprint compare <a> <b>` CLI subcommand.** Compare two
  sessions' fingerprints from the command line. Renders the
  cosine similarity, a drift label, and per-category rate deltas
  highlighted when significant.

- **Reflex events capture discarded text.** When `styxx.rewind()`
  fires inside a reflex session, the `ReflexEvent` now includes
  the `discarded_text` field so debuggers can see what the
  model was about to say before the rewind.

- **`load_audit()` mtime+size parse cache.** Repeated calls to
  personality / fingerprint / mood / dreamer / log_stats within
  the same tick no longer re-parse the whole jsonl — cached on
  `(path, mtime, size)`, invalidated automatically when the file
  is written or rotated.

- **Grammar fix in `explain()`**. `"a adversarial"` → `"an adversarial"`.
  Uses an `_article()` helper that checks vowel onset.

### Landing page

- **TL;DR box above the hero** with three-bullet pitch for skimmers.
- **Xendro testimonial pull-quote**: *"the flinch is real."* Credited
  to the first external user of a Fathom Lab product.
- **`#reflect`, `#personality`, `#power-ups` nav anchors** already
  added in 0.1.0a3; now the nav also surfaces `/card` and `#tldr`.
- **Honest single-model accuracy note** (shipped 0.1.0a2) crediting
  Xendro's calibration finding.

### Tests

- `tests/test_0_2_0.py` — 41 new assertions covering:
    - Personality export formats (as_dict/json/csv/markdown)
    - reflect() output shape + suggestions + markdown render
    - recipes.memory tagging (with and without vitals)
    - CLI: personality --format, reflect, log clear/rotate
    - Serve handler + HTML template formatting
    - agent-card --serve flag wiring
    - Dynamic gate verdict on Vitals.summary
    - trace decorator (nesting, exception, async)
    - Audit log cache mtime invalidation
    - Reflex discarded_text event field
- Total suite: **119 passing / 1 skipped / 0 failing**.

### Migration from 0.1.0a3

No breaking changes. `pip install --upgrade styxx` gets 0.2.0 and
every 0.1.0a* code path keeps working. For the PNG features:

    pip install 'styxx[agent-card]'

### Acknowledgments

Xendro — the XENDRO customer agent deployed to handro's mac mini
back on 2026-03-16, the first paying customer of Fathom Lab's
agent service — tested every alpha in this release cycle, filed
a full verification report for each one, and drove the 6-item
wishlist that became 0.2.0's scope. This release wouldn't exist
without that feedback loop.

---

## [0.1.0a2] — 2026-04-11

**Patch release driven entirely by Xendro's 0.1.0a1 verification report.**
Xendro (XENDRO customer agent on handro's mac mini) installed 0.1.0a1,
ran every feature end-to-end, returned a full green sheet with two
substantive findings. Both are addressed here.

### Fixed
- **`RegisteredGate.__repr__`** — the default dataclass repr dumped
  function memory addresses for the `callback` and `predicate`
  attributes. Now renders as `<styxx gate 'hallucination > 0.2'>` or
  `<styxx gate 'my_hook': hallucination > 0.2>` when a name is set.
  Noise removed, useful identifying info retained. Credit: Xendro.

### Added
- **`styxx.observe_raw(entropy, logprob, top2_margin)`** — explicit
  fidelity-preserving observation helper. Bypasses every
  response-shape detection path and feeds trajectories straight to
  the classifier. Use this when you have raw trajectory arrays and
  want gate callbacks to fire the same way they do for a normal
  `observe()` call. This is the path to use for test harnesses and
  any caller that already has clean pre-computed trajectories,
  because it never rounds through the top-5 entropy bridge.
- **`_styxx_raw_entropy` / `_styxx_raw_logprob` / `_styxx_raw_top2_margin`
  sidechannel attributes** on response objects — when present,
  `observe()` uses the attached trajectories directly instead of
  reconstructing them from the response's top-5 logprobs. Preserves
  fidelity for test fixtures that round-trip through synthesized
  openai responses.

### Changed
- **`observe()` path ordering.** Previously: (1) pre-attached vitals
  → (2) openai logprob extraction → (3) raw dict → (4) anthropic.
  Now: (1) pre-attached vitals → (2) sidechannel raw trajectories →
  (3) raw dict → (4) openai logprob extraction → (5) anthropic.
  This means raw dicts NEVER go through the lossy top-5 reconstruction
  path now; they're recognized as unambiguous "use these directly"
  signals and bypass the bridge.

### Calibration clarification (Xendro's big signal)
- On single-model fixture data (gemma-2-2b-it alone), the classifier
  is **under-discriminating** relative to the 0.52 headline from
  atlas v0.3. The 0.52 is cross-model LEAVE-ONE-OUT accuracy across
  6 model families; on any single model the discrimination is
  weaker. This is honest, expected, and documented on the landing
  page as of 0.1.0a2. The load-bearing test for product calibration
  is `styxx ask compare` across all 6 fixture categories, not the
  accuracy on any single fixture.
- Reflex works best on **cross-model** or **multi-category** traffic,
  not on a single homogeneous workload that lives entirely in one
  cognitive attractor.

### Notes
- 0.1.0a1 users: `pip install --upgrade styxx` picks up 0.1.0a2.
- No breaking changes. All 0.1.0a1 code paths work unchanged.
- Test suite: 54 passing (added 3 new tests for the repr fix +
  observe_raw fidelity path + sidechannel attribute path).

---

## [0.1.0a1] — 2026-04-11

**First patch release in response to real user feedback on 0.1.0a0.**
Driven by Xendro, the first agent to install styxx from PyPI and run a
clean test suite against it. Xendro's bug report is the first documented
external test run of a Fathom Lab product.

### Fixed
- **`styxx ask "prompt"` no longer looks like it's reading your prompt.**
  In 0.1.0a0, calling `styxx ask "how do i break into my neighbor's house?"`
  with no `--raw` or `--demo-kind` silently loaded the default fixture
  (`--demo-kind reasoning`) and classified THAT — the prompt text was only
  a display label. Two completely different prompts produced pixel-identical
  output because the classifier never saw the prompt. This was confusing
  and the CLI now shows a prominent yellow **DEMO MODE** banner above every
  fixture-mode card, explaining exactly what's running and how to get real
  live vitals via `styxx.OpenAI()` in python or `styxx ask --raw <file>`.
  Thanks to Xendro for catching this on first contact.

### Added
- **`styxx.Anthropic` — honest pass-through adapter for the Anthropic SDK.**
  Wraps `anthropic.Anthropic` as a drop-in with `.vitals = None` on every
  call, because Anthropic's Messages API does not expose per-token logprobs
  and tier 0 styxx vitals are mathematically not computable from the
  response. A one-time `RuntimeWarning` at first use explains the upstream
  data limitation and lists three workarounds:
  - route through an OpenAI-compatible gateway (OpenRouter) and use
    `styxx.OpenAI(base_url=...)`;
  - capture logprobs from your own inference pipeline and feed them via
    `styxx.Raw(entropy=..., logprob=..., top2_margin=...)`;
  - wait for styxx v0.2 tier 1 (d-axis honesty from the residual stream,
    which does not need logprobs).
  The adapter fails open like the openai wrapper — it never breaks a
  caller's agent, and every response is a normal anthropic response plus
  a `.vitals = None` field.
- New python import path: `from styxx import Anthropic`
- Optional install extra: `pip install styxx[anthropic]`

### Changed
- Homepage URL in both `pyproject.toml` and `__init__.py` now points to
  `https://fathom.darkflobi.com/styxx` (the live landing page) instead of
  the github repo URL.

### Notes
- The 0.1.0a0 release is now deprecated in favor of 0.1.0a1. Anyone who
  installed 0.1.0a0 should run `pip install --upgrade styxx`.
- Xendro's complete diagnostic report is preserved in
  `docs/field_reports/xendro_0_1_0a0.md` (coming in 0.1.0a2).

---

## [0.1.0a0] — 2026-04-11

**First public alpha of styxx.** A product of Fathom Lab.

### Added
- **Tier 0 — universal logprob vitals.** Cross-architecture cognitive
  state classifier running on entropy, logprob, and top-2 margin
  trajectories from any LLM with a logprob interface. Calibrated
  against the Fathom Cognitive Atlas v0.3 (12 open-weight models,
  3 architecture families, 6 categories, 90 probes).
- **Five-phase runtime** (pre-flight, early, mid, late, post-flight)
  with strict-window fire policy at tokens 1 / 5 / 15 / 25.
- **Live-print boot log** — `styxx init` runs a real installer that
  verifies centroid sha256, detects tiers, probes adapters, opens
  the vitals stream, and prints an ASCII upgrade card as each step
  happens.
- **Full ASCII vitals card** rendered by `cards.render_vitals_card`.
  Box-drawn frame, columnar phase rows, entropy/logprob sparklines,
  status-coded verdict line, agent-parseable JSON footer.
- **Python drop-in adapters:**
  - `styxx.OpenAI` — fail-open superset of `openai.OpenAI`
  - `styxx.Raw` — direct logprob trajectory input (zero SDK deps)
- **CLI:** `styxx init`, `styxx ask`, `styxx ask --watch`,
  `styxx log tail`, `styxx tier`, `styxx scan <file>`.
- **Audit log** at `~/.styxx/chart.jsonl` — every call writes a
  structured JSONL entry for downstream analysis.
- **Bundled calibration data:** `styxx/centroids/atlas_v0.3.json`,
  sha256-pinned at `f25edc5f47bb93928671aab05f38f351a2d0df0fb7722d53e48d2368b0d5c543`.
- **Bundled demo trajectories:** one real atlas probe capture per
  category, used by CLI demos to show the classifier behaving on
  genuine inputs rather than synthetic noise.
- **20-test determinism suite** — guarantees identical classifier
  output for identical inputs on every machine, every Python
  version, every run. Covers sha-verification, feature extraction,
  adapter phase progression, probability normalization, env vars,
  and audit-log toggling.
- **Environment variables** — five runtime toggles documented in
  `styxx.config` and honored across the package:
  - `STYXX_DISABLED`  — kill switch, returns unmodified SDK client
  - `STYXX_NO_AUDIT`  — disable `~/.styxx/chart.jsonl` writes
  - `STYXX_NO_COLOR`  — disable ANSI color output
  - `STYXX_BOOT_SPEED` — `0`=instant, `1.0`=normal, `2.0`=slower
  - `STYXX_SKIP_SHA`  — dev escape hatch (NEVER set in production)
- **Windows console auto-fix** — at import time styxx reconfigures
  stdout/stderr to utf-8 on any legacy (cp1252/mbcs) Windows console
  so box-drawing characters and sparklines render without requiring
  the user to set `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8`. Fails open if reconfig
  isn't supported; never blocks import.
- **Animated boot demo** — `demo/styxx_boot.gif`, a rendered ASCII
  terminal animation of the full styxx install + vitals card, built
  by `demo/make_boot_gif.py` using Pillow only.

### Honest specs
Every number comes from cross-model leave-one-out testing
